0,Dear : Jane Clark.
1,I had been to your annual international art festival.
2,"Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year."
3,"So, I write some of my opinions and suggestions to you."
4,I hope it's may help for next year's festival.
5,"The idea of an ""International Art Festival"" was great."
6,"But I feel the word ""of""/""International"" was not really suitable; because you just only got six countries' stars and artists came."
7,I think you should invite more than ten countries.
8,The other problem was choosing space.
9,"Like, as the hall of the classical concert was too small and crowded."
10,"Next year, you should calculate or examine how many people will come before you choose a hall, which I feel very good was played and films."
11,It can show more for next year's festival.
12,The Dance Shows as well.
13,"And the offer of a ""weekend ticket"" was an excellent idea."
14,Because the price was cheaper than buying it separately and more convenient.
15,Looking forward to next year's festival.
16,"One day, a little girl called Sara."
17,She was walking over a bridge.
18,"Suddenly, she heard a man's voice calling her."
19,The original sentence is correct: Sara.
20,Look down to the river.
21,"""Then Sara looked down into the river."
22,She was very scared.
23,"Because, because she saw a golden fish who was smiling at her and talking to her."
24,"After a few seconds, Sara felt that the golden fish was lovely."
25,She has never seen any fish that had that wonderful color and can talk with her.
26,"Because Sara hasn't got any brothers and sisters, and her Mom and Dad need to work everyday, so she was very lonely."
27,"Therefore, she came to the river everyday and talked about everything with the golden fish."
28,They were very close friend.
29,"After half a year, the golden fish suddenly disappears."
30,Sara was very sad.
31,She sat and cried on the river.
32,"Then somebody called her name "": Sara"""
33,I'm standing on your left hand side.
34,Sara remembered the was golden fish.
35,"She becomes a human, a little boy."
36,"After a few days, they got married."
37,Both together had their wonderful life.
38,This story happened a long time ago.
39,"I am writing to give suggestions for the international art festival, which I have been to one week before ago."
40,"It was really good, but I feel it could be better next year."
41,"Firstly, I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival, it."
42,"It is very interesting, especially for the young people."
43,I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time there very much.
44,"It was said that stars and artists from around the world would be there on the advertisement, but in fact they were from only six different countries, so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year."
45,"Although the jazz, rock and classical music was great, some concerts and halls were too small. Could."
46,Could you consider making them bigger next year.
47,"The plays and films were really wonderful, people."
48,"People liked them very much, so could you play more next year."
49,The last thing is about the ticket.
50,"It was excellent about to have one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events, because it is convenient and normally young people do not have a lot of money, so I hope next year the ticket will be also like this."
51,I hope that you can consider my suggestions.
52,I really look forward to going to the festival next year.
53,"The original sentence is error-free, so the correction tag is not needed:"
54,I'm very glad to hear from you.
55,I hope everything is ok.
56,"I'm really sorry I didn't write you back immediately, because I was preparing my exam at that moment, so can you forgive me? We should keep in touch with each other, because you know I'm very happy to have a friend like you."
57,"In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country."
58,I'd like to tell you.
59,"In school, we have lots of rules, especially in the class and some of them are quite strange."
60,"For example, we can't go to the toilet during lessons."
61,We should go there in the brake.
62,And we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom.
63,"If you fail three subjects in your exam, you will be kicked out of school."
64,I don't like it.
65,"If I could, I would like to change this, because I don't think everyone can succeed at once."
66,We should give them a second chance to try.
67,"Anyway, in my country, generally, children are free at home, but it also depends on their parents."
68,"For me, I don't have rules at home - I just don't make trouble for my family."
69,I look forward to hearing from you soon.
70,All the best wishes and good luck.
71,"I have seen your advertisement in ""the Sun"" newspaper on 10th November, and I went to the festival on last Friday."
72,Most of the events were wonderful and well-organized.
73,"I enjoyed it, but I think it could be even better next year, so I would like to give my immature views of it."
74,"Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great."
75,"It made people enjoyed their weekend, relaxed themselves, and also it brought the foreign culture to them, enlarging their knowledge."
76,"In addition to it, one weekend ticket for all events was only £10."
77,"This was excellent, it."
78,"It made people only spend pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events at the weekend."
79,For them it is a really economical way to spend their weekend.
80,So my friends told me that this was their cheapest weekend.
81,"Moreover, the stars and artists were from only six countries."
82,"In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more interesting, and some of the concert halls were too small."
83,The people in there couldn't even go to the loo because it was too crowed.
84,"Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed, as far as I'm concerned."
85,"If you can show more plays and films, it will achieve a good effect."
86,"This are only my immature views, if."
87,"If it is considerate for you, I will be very pleased."
88,Thank you very much.
89,I'm looking forward to hearing your reply.
90,"It was really pleased to receive your letter yesterday, you."
91,"You asked me about rules, both at my home and at my school."
92,I am very happy to tell you about this.
93,"At my school, we aren't allowed to smoke inside the building, because the building is made of wood."
94,"It tends to catch fire easily, and we aren't allowed to use the Internet."
95,There are only ten computers in the school.
96,"Only teachers can use it, if."
97,"If we used them, we would be sent to the head office of the school."
98,"At my home, there are many rules because I'm careless, so I am not allowed to smoke at home neither am I allowed to use the telephone, because last year I made a £1000 bill for one month."
99,"My parents were very angry with it, so they told me I am not to use the telephone any more, oh."
100,How is the weather like in England.
101,"I hope it isn't too wet, please."
102,Please give my regards to your parents.
103,I'm writing to express my feeling and opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held a few days ago.
104,"When I found the advertisement of the International Arts Festival, I was very excited."
105,It is great to hold an annual international arts festival in this place.
106,Then I spent two days at the festival.
107,I enjoyed it very much.
108,"There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world."
109,"Jazz, jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance shows etc."
110,"The specified thing that is worth reminding here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourists could offer what they like."
111,"Although I enjoyed it, there were still something that needed to be improved."
112,"For example, there were some concert halls which were too small to hold so many people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for the audience."
113,"In the addition, when you organize the next year's international arts festival, could you arrange more plays and films."
114,"Thanks for reading this letter, I'm looking forward to the next year's festival."
115,It is lovely to get your letter so soon.
116,You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter.
117,This remind me of what I experienced during my teenage years.
118,"In my country, the children go to secondary school when they are at in the first year of being a teenager."
119,"Your know, this age is the trouble age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone."
120,These they always annoy the school teacher and their parents.
121,"In result of these, the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak to each other in the class."
122,They had to finish homework in a limited time.
123,"They cannot oppose the teacher, girls are not allowed to wear make-up and or wear any jewellery."
124,"At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me much homework to do, even in the holidays."
125,They also forbade me to have a boyfriend.
126,"I think it is not just what happened in my home, many of my friends had the same experience."
127,Now I'm a mother of two children.
128,They are all in the school.
129,"Comparing to my experience, I want to give them a more open attitude about everything."
130,I want to be a mother of them and a friend to them.
131,"But at school, although I hope the teacher doesn't give students so much homework, and isn't forbidden the opposite voice of the students, there is nothing I can do because of our culture."
132,I'm looking forward to receiving your next letter soon.
133,"No errors or corrections needed for this sentence, as it is already grammatically correct."
134,I'd like to complain about your Best musical show that I went to when I'd a week's holiday in London.
135,I felt really disappointed because the things you said in the advertisement wasn't true.
136,I went there at 19.
137,00 because the show started at 7.
138,30 as the advertisement said but I queued for at least an hour because the ticket machine broke down.
139,"Finally, after an hour, when my turn came to buy the entrance ticket, you staff said I couldn't have a discount and so as anyone."
140,"However, I bought the ticket even though it was more expensive because I'd been queuing for ages and I really wanted to see my favourite idol, Danny Brook."
141,"But when the show started, they said Danny wasn't there because of his illness and I felt very upset and dismayed about it because the situation I had was unlike what the advertisement promised."
142,"After the boring show finished, I was hungry and I decided to go to your theatre restaurant but the restaurant was closed after 19."
143,"The original sentence is empty, as there are no words or punctuation marks present."
144,So what's the point of saying visit our restaurant after the show?
145,I'd a very disappointing evening and my anger influenced me for the rest of my holidays.
146,I'd like to know if you can give the money back to me or I'll write letters to all the media departments to show how tricky you were.
147,"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."
148,He went to see the headmaster and told him all the truth.
149,Tim was the one who threw the paper aeroplane to the headmaster and Jon was the one who said some bad words behind the headmaster's back after he punished John.
150,"The headmaster was extremely angry about it and he gave both students a heavy punishment, which was suspended from school for a week."
151,This happened in the Thursday afternoon.
152,"When everyone finished their lunch, they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster would walk round the school every Thursday."
153,But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper airplanes when the teacher was writing something on the board.
154,"Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit directly to the headmaster's head."
155,Everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger.
156,"He then punished Jon but the one who did it was Tim, so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster."
157,Pat heard that and he went to see the headmaster straight after school.
158,The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished them for their bad behaviour.
159,"After that event happened, Pat was Jon and Tim's enemy."
160,They both got into trouble because of him.
161,They do hate him so much.
162,"Dear Sir or Madam,"
163,I have recently been to the Circle Theatre and watched the musical show - Over the Rainbow.
164,I am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which is was published in the newspaper.
165,"According to the advert, it says clearly that discounts are available, but when I was buying the tickets, I did not have this offer."
166,"As a result, I had to pay the full price of £15."
167,The second point is that the show had a delay of about 30 minutes.
168,"Although I believe there must have been problems, I expect your company managed to sort it out in the quickest way."
169,"Apart from that, the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, for whom I was coming."
170,"After the show we went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed due to the refurbishment."
171,I was not really satisfied about the show and I certainly believe that it was not a perfect evening out.
172,I therefore would like to have a compensation of the £30 which I spent on the tickets.
173,"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."
174,My story had already been spread out the next day.
175,"Although failing in the exams wasn't really a big deal, it was awful that people kept mentioning it."
176,I thought I was not going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustworthy.
177,But this idea was soon put off since I noticed in the newspaper that I had won the writing competition.
178,I couldn't believe my luck.
179,I was really sure that I won a return ticket to the Mediterranean Sea.
180,"During the trip, I made friends with other people who had also won the competition in their towns."
181,They were so kind to me that we soon became good friends.
182,"The last few days, we spent our time on sightseeing and shopping."
183,I must admit that it was the greatest time I have ever had in my life.
184,"On the last day when I was packing and getting ready to leave, I realized I had lost my passport and tickets."
185,A horrible thought suddenly came into my mind.
186,My bad luck had never left me.
187,"It had only hidden away from me and when there was a chance, it was going to give me a surprise."
188,"I am writing to complain about the musical show : Over the Rainbow, presented in your theatre on 15th of June."
189,I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to have a discount as I was a student.
190,"However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had been sold out."
191,"I could not understand why, but I still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook."
192,"Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry for waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time."
193,"Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so bad that I left the theatre before it finished."
194,"At last, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning."
195,I think it was definitely not the perfect evening as guaranteed in your advertisement.
196,I look forward to having a full refund in the very near future as I did not enjoy it at all.
197,"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."
198,Now everybody in the class knew my mum was a cleaner and teased me for having such kind of mum.
199,I was so sad about it and did not forgive Pat even though she apologized for thousands of times.
200,"A week later, when I was still in a bad mood, my form teacher, Mrs Brown, talked about jobs in our English lesson."
201,She told us there were numerous types of job in the world.
202,Some offered a high salary while some did not.
203,"However, they are equally important for our society."
204,Who wants to be a doctor? She asked.
205,Many students raised there hands.
206,"Who wants to be a lawyer? Again, many students put up their hand."
207,"But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner, nobody raised his hand and I felt so shameful that I lowered my head."
208,Cleaner is a very good job.
209,Mrs Brown said with a loud voice.
210,"If there were no cleaner, who would clean the school for us? Who would keep the environment nice and tidy."
211,"Suddenly, all the classmates applauded and smiled to me with respect."
212,"The teacher also grinned and I was so impressed and repeated the words in my heart: ""All the jobs have the same importance."""
213,"The original sentence is empty, as there are no words or punctuation inside the '' tags."
214,Dear Sir or Madam :.
215,I am writing this letter in order to complain about my unpleasant experience in at your theatre.
216,"Two days ago, I went to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" at your theatre."
217,The advertised starting time is 19:30.
218,"But due to for some unknown reasons, the play didn't start until 20:15."
219,The audience were anxious and bored.
220,What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear on the stage at all.
221,A second-class actor took his place.
222,We felt totally disappointed and cheated.
223,"After the show, I was hungry and tired."
224,"As your poster suggested, I intended to rest for a while at your restaurant."
225,"But when I got there, it had closed."
226,"In addition, the conductor didn't offer me any discounts as you had advertised on the poster when I bought the ticket."
227,I am sorry to say that I did not enjoy the evening at your theatre at all.
228,I hope you can pay me the money back as compensation.
229,I am waiting for your reply.
230,Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways.
231,"First with a lot of advanced techniques being put into practical use, our living conditions becomes more and more convenient and comfortable."
232,"When we look around in the house, it is easy to find things like these : a microwave oven, TV set, computer, etc."
233,All these items of equipment are the applications of modern science.
234,"When you are planning to travel, you can choose a train, car or even a plane as your means of transportation."
235,"Without the development of modern technology, it may take your several years to reach the destination."
236,"Second, Modern technology makes communication much easier and more enjoyable."
237,"With the spreading use of the Internet, people living in different parts of the world can chat with each other through the web."
238,"And, we can also share important informations with other people."
239,"The development of information technology has changed the world into ""an earth village""."
240,Modern technology plays an important role in our life.
241,I am hoping to devote myself into the development of it.
242,To: Manager of the Theatre
243,"Few weeks ago, me and my farmily had a holiday in London, the."
244,"The holiday wasn't too good! Because, because."
245,During the week we decided where we wanted to go.
246,"We all agreed to listen to music so then we decided to come to your musical show and listen to ""Over the Rainbow""."
247,That evening we don't want to have our supper before the show.
248,"Anyway I thought it would be too early to eat and also because the timetable or candidates you give me have say: ""visit our theatre restaurant after the show""."
249,"So we did, but unfortunately it was close and I was so disappointed about it, not only because we had expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove to be the actors in the starring role."
250,"Also I don't really mind that the show started late, but the route of that evening was centered."
251,And there were no discounts when you said there would be! Why is it everything that's on the candidates that were wrong and different from what we had experienced?
252,"We don't expect much bad to happen on our holiday, but this was a perfect show as well, it was the worst show and theatre I have ever been to in my life."
253,"The original sentence is empty, so there is no correction. The student simply wrote the letter ""S""."
254,"Please would you like to explain why this happened? We would like our money back, please because everything gone wrong."
255,The atmosphere totally changed!
256,Modern technology changed our daily life.
257,"In order to help us live happily, the scientists can easily predict the changes on earth, so than we can have time to prepare or defend our self from natural disasters."
258,Weapons were designed to kill and defend in a fight.
259,"In the Second World War, so many Germans were killed."
260,Also many people died from other regions.
261,"The original sentence is empty, as there is no text in the tagged sentence."
262,"Posin chemical compounds, e."
263,"Gases, and liquids, are created too."
264,"They were used to kill people, most..."
265,"Most of them give radiration, which can disable the person, mostly harming their brain and their bodies, and it could also cause deaths."
266,"The original sentence is empty, so the correction is also empty:"
267,"internet (networks), and mobile phones."
268,In the wars soldiers were communicate with mobile phones though places to place to get or give information about themselves and the enemy.
269,"By using the internet we could make new pen friends oversea, and create clubs."
270,Now a message can travel quicker and it is also world wide.
271,Sending letters takes about a week to Hong Kong from the U.
272,"The original sentence is blank, so the correction is simply ""K""."
273,"', but net work."
274,"The original sentence is empty, so the correction is also empty:"
275,", is much faster."
276,The time required is about only a few minutes.
277,"Now we could even create a club in Yahoo, which is free."
278,"Modern technology saves us a lot of times and brings us many benefits when we use it in the right ways, but some bad ways to use it."
279,Send virus to break down network.
280,I recentely had a week's holiday in London.
281,"During my stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show, which was OVER THE RAINBOW however."
282,"However, I had a very disappointing evening."
283,There are a lot of differences between the details of the musical show on the advertisement and the ones it actually was.
284,"Firstly, the starring stars on the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, while there were different actors in the musical show."
285,Secondly time starts at 19:30 on the leafet but it actually started at 20:15.
286,"Thirdly it said there were discounts available in the advertisement, however."
287,"However, there were not any at all."
288,"Finally it said we could visit your theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because your excuse of being used at that moment."
289,"It said on the leaflet that this would be a perfect evening out, while it was not that at all."
290,I felt very disappointing after seeing the music show in your theatre.
291,"As I said the reasons above, I want to ask for my money back! I look forward to hearing from you."
292,"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."
293,He was so kind that the he couldn't resist telling Janet that she was going to be killed by Mr. Brown.
294,"After finishing that, Pat left this room."
295,Janet was so nervous that she couldn't stop her heart throbbing quickly.
296,She went quietly downstairs and closed the door as soon as she went into her room.
297,At that moment a lot of things appeared in her mind which seemed as if they had just happened yesterday.
298,"""Why did Mr Brown want to kill me?"" She said to herself."
299,"""I am just a servant in this castle."""
300,"I love him so much and I don't want anything from him, although he is the owner of this castle."
301,"""While it seemed as if a shadow came in from through the window and disappeared quickly."""
302,"Everything in the room is quiet except the sound of the clock, as if everything was going to die."
303,She was so frightened and sad that she had no energy.
304,"She fell down onto the floor and wept, while nobody could help her."
305,I am writing to you to complain about the show which I saw last Friday at your theatre.
306,The show was called 'Over the rainbow'.
307,I was not pleased with the way that it was set out.
308,"First of all, when I went and bought my ticket, there was no discount, but in your advertisement it said clearly that discounts are available and as a result, my ticket was bought more expensive."
309,"Secondly, the show I went to was the evening one, which was supposed to start at 7:30 p."
310,But it had a 41-minute delay and it ended up starting at 8.
311,"The original sentence is simply ""m"", which means the learner misspelled the letter ""m"". The corrected sentence is ""m""."
312,"Furthermore, the original actor was Danny Brook but it changed to a different actor who acted terribly and was very disappointing."
313,"Last of all, it said in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant open after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was being redecorated and no announcement was made."
314,I didn't have a perfect evening out and instead I had an awful evening out.
315,Therefore I would like are refund of my ticket and I would like an apology.
316,Thank you from you.
317,"What will clothes be like 100 years from now? What do you think models will wear in the catwalks? Will they wear anything? Who knows? Nowadays, people look at fashion magazines or get opinions from their friends to decide what to wear in different occasions."
318,Will they still do the same 100 years later?
319,"In my opinion, I think clothes will be a lot different in 100 years later compare to now."
320,"As new materials are made and new styles are created either by designers or people themselves, which leads to changes in fashion, but on the other hand come materials will probably still be used such as jeans, which was invented ages ago in America."
321,And people nowadays still use jeans as a common material.
322,"If you walk out on to the street now, you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made with jeans, which is incredibly surprising!"
323,"From my point of view, I think people will wear more clothes that are see-through in particular."
324,"As people are wearing thinner and thinner clothes to show off their figure, they might as well just wear clothes that are see-through to give it a better effect! So if you want to know what clothes will be like 100 years later, the only thing you can do is to WAIT!"
325,"No errors or corrections needed, as the sentence is already in its original and corrected form."
326,I am writing to complain about the musical show which was held last week.
327,I feel disappointed because it was different to what was promised in the advertisement.
328,"First of all, the performers should have been Danny Brook and Tina Truelove."
329,"However, there were two unknown actors in the show."
330,I feel most disappointed about this.
331,The show was started at 20.
332,15 but actually it should have started at 19.
333,"The original sentence is untagged, meaning it does not have any errors or corrections. The learner wrote ""30"" correctly without any mistakes."
334,"Moreover, I bought a £20 ticket without any discount even and the advertisement mentioned that a discount was available."
335,"And after the show, we went to visit the theatre restaurant."
336,"Unfortunately, it was closed because at that day was their day-off."
337,But I am wondering why it said we could visit the restaurant if you knew it would be closed.
338,I am afraid it was not the best musical show because all the things above was not an accurate as what we had been told.
339,"On the whole, I feel disappointed about the event and I would like to have my money back."
340,I look forward to hearing your reply.
341,"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."
342,I say this because of the experience I've had from with her.
343,"Actually, we were quite good friends before this event happened."
344,Pat has been studying in the same class with me since this year.
345,"She is sitting next to me, we."
346,"We started to chat more and more, then."
347,Then we became good friends.
348,"One day, we were sitting in the dinning-hall like usually."
349,Suddenly my heart was thumping so quickly because I saw him - A boy who is a new student.
350,I know this is one right love.
351,I'm absolutely besorrted of him.
352,Then I told this to Pat and told her to keep it secret: I didn't want people gossiping behind me then everyone would know I fancyed him.
353,But the thing which I've never expected is that Pat betrayed me.
354,She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always makes a joke on it.
355,That makes me feel so embarrassed: I was very angry at that time!
356,"Now, I don't talk to her anymore because I can't stand a person who betrayed me."
357,I hope she would know that it was her fault and won't do it anymore.
358,Re: The Musical Show Presented by the Circle Theatre.
359,"With reference to the advertisement published in the New Strait Times newspaper on May 22nd, 2000, I, as a consumer and customer of the musical show, who is an avid fan of Danny Brook, who is said to have starred in the show, would like to complain about the presentation."
360,The original sentence is correct as it is: 1.
361,"First of all, I was really furious about watching a show starring by a different actor, instead of Danny Brook."
362,Whose name was stated on the advertisement.
363,"Besides this, the show started almost 45 minutes later than what it was said to be."
364,"The original sentence is empty, so the correction is also empty:"
365,The Price of the ticket was said that there would be discounts available.
366,"However, I was completely disappointed when I was told that there were not any discounts for the show."
367,I also found out that the theatre restaurant was not opened after the show due to the shortage of food sold.
368,I was really hungry after the show and was pissed off.
369,"With considering all the above points, I would like to ask for some money return."
370,I would consider taking this complaint to the court if I do not receive any agreeable explanation from the theatre.
371,"Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss about in the past, now and also in the future."
372,"However, things are recycling from time to time."
373,So do the objective of wearing clothes.
374,"I will imagine that people in the future, for example 100 years from now, will wear clothes for protection like people did in the past."
375,"The people in the past wore clothes to protect themselves from the cold air, hot weather and strong wind."
376,"On the other hand, the people in the future will probably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water, the harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun, and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which is the result of a developed and full-grown country."
377,I think people in the future will likely wear helmets with oxygen gas well provided.
378,It is because of the increasing number of the population and the shortage of the oxygen gas in the atmosphere.
379,"They will also wear water-proof, ultra-violet proof and other dangerous liquid-proof clothes to protect themselves."
380,"These clothes have to be made of something light, suitable to wear and protective."
381,All the above ideas are needed to make them bare no burden when wearing these special designed clothes.
382,The future is a hope and a dream for everyone in on the earth.
383,"Therefore, I will suggest that we all nov to keep the environment clean and healthy for the next generation."
384,Dear Manager of the theatre:
385,I am writing a letter to complain about the musical show I saw last week when I was in London.
386,"I thought that I would have a great time there, but I was really disappointed in that evening."
387,"You said there would be stars such as Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, whose music is my favourite, but the musicians were actually some other people whose names I had never heard of."
388,"In the advertisement of the show, you said it would begin at 19."
389,"Actually, it was delayed 45 minutes."
390,The discounts were not exist.
391,"It could make things worse that our visit to your theatre restaurant, which had already been closed because of a lack of customers, was canceled."
392,"However, what a let down!"
393,I would be grateful if you could give us the our money back.
394,"If I cannot get your satisfactory reply within a month, I shall go to the consumer protection organization to sue you."
395,I am looking forward to hearing from you.
396,How has modern technology changed our daily life.
397,Our life has been influenced by modern technology.
398,"Five years ago, you could be proud of your 486 computer, which can only be put inside a museum as an antique now."
399,Then how does it changed our daily life?
400,I have been an enthusiast of music for a long time.
401,I used a tape player and I felt it was excellent.
402,"Today, there are multi-choices, such as a discman (CD player)."
403,"MD walkman and MP3 player, which are considered to be more portable and have a better timbre sound quality."
404,"Communication has been more conventional, we can simply make a phone call, and send emails or faxes instead of writing letters and waiting for a long time."
405,Especially the improvement in the sophistication of personal computers has greatly helped the spread of information by.
406,"By using the Internet, you can book newspapers, and even go shopping online."
407,"Therefore, our life has been influenced and changed by the developing of technology."
408,"In conclusion, we should work hard to learn knowledge, making the future better and better."
409,I recently had a holiday in London and had been to your musical show Over the Rainbow but found it very disappointing.
410,It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement.
411,"However, there was a different unknown actor in that."
412,"The show started later, at 20:15 which was very different in '19."
413,"There was no discount at all, which is in contrast with Discounts Available."
414,"After the show, I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason."
415,The real show is really very different to what are mentioned in the advertisement.
416,I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back.
417,Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts.
418,Thank you for your attention.
419,What will clothes be like 100 years from now? It is a very hard thing to predict.
420,The fashion of nowaday clothing is just keeps on changing.
421,"Although some may appears again after a few years, different styles are developed."
422,"For the fashion of the future, I think it depends on the people's own personalities and they develop their own styles which suits them the most."
423,"They can wear different kinds of clothing, like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of Victorian time and in different countries."
424,"For the colours, I think the metallic colours, especially silver, will be the most popular."
425,As different kinds of fabrics will be invented and the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen.
426,Maybe paper can also be a fabric use to make clothing and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday.
427,They can be thrown away after wearing it and are light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change what you're wearing.
428,"Dear Sir or Madam,"
429,"I am writing to complain about the musical show, which gave me a very disappointing evening, while I was staying in London."
430,"Firstly, there was a different actor instead of the famous actor, Danny Brook."
431,That made me so disappointed.
432,"Secondly, I suppose the show will start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15."
433,It caused me to miss the train and I went back to the hotel when it was nearly mid-night.
434,"Another problem is, I realized that the discounts were available."
435,"However, there wasn't any discount."
436,"Additionally, the advertisement said I could visit the theatre restaurant after the show."
437,"When I arrived, it was closed."
438,That is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice.
439,I expected to receive the money back within these two days.
440,Otherwise I would like to take the other further action.
441,"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."
442,"I told Pat everything, even my secrets, when we were still friendly."
443,"However, we are not friends anymore because of a secret in the past."
444,It was a very long time since I was in Year 7.
445,I told Pat that my father and mother were going to separate.
446,I told her because I wanted somebody to share my feeling.
447,"Maybe it was the wrong decision to tell her, she."
448,"She began to spread that secret to everybody, including the teachers."
449,They tried to contact with my parents.
450,My parents were very angry when they realized what had happened.
451,All my friends were trying to keep their distance with me.
452,That was all because of Pat.
453,"At last, I decided to go to the other school and I will not tell any secret to the others."
454,"I am writing to complain about a musical show which is called ""Over The Rainbow"" and ask for my money back."
455,This show was presented by the Circle Theatre.
456,"First of all, the poster told me that this show was performed by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but there were different actors."
457,I am so disappointed.
458,"Secondly, the show was expected to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15."
459,I have been waiting for 45 minutes.
460,The poster also told me that I could visit the theatre restaurant after the show.
461,"As you know the show started late, so I was not able to go to the theatre restaurant because it was closed before the show has been finished."
462,"Thirdly, there were no discounts available but it was printed on the poster."
463,"If there were no discounts, don't write it on the poster."
464,I got confused and was disappointed again.
465,"Finally, I would like to have my money back."
466,I am looking forward for your prompt reply and improvement.
467,How has modern technology changed your daily life?
468,The world is changing every day.
469,"So, modern technology is needed to meet the requirement."
470,"In every single day, many modern technology is produced and it really affects or changes our daily life."
471,"The most important development is the Internet system, which is connected to the whole world's computers by some telephone lines."
472,You can send a letter to your friend by an e-mail but not instead of writing it on a piece of paper and sending it by post.
473,It just takes you a few minutes.
474,"How convenience it is! There are also much more advantages, you."
475,You can buy something in a supermarket by only a mail order.
476,You don't need to leave your home.
477,"Other than the Internet, there is also many modern technology which is changing our daily life."
478,"For example, we can go to the Mars and do some investigation research."
479,"So, we know much more about our universe."
480,Some modern technology is also put into the transport system.
481,"For example, trains can go faster and aeroplanes can travel faster."
482,The modern technology has changed our daily life.
483,It aims at improving our standard of life and makes us live more comfortably.
484,So I think the changes are good.
485,"... musical show &#x3c;Best musical show, which I went to when I had a week's holiday in London."
486,No errors or corrections required. The sentence is already in its original and corrected form.
487,I am writing to complain about a musical show last weekend when I was in London.
488,I felt very upset about your advertisement was totally different between the musical show.

490,"Secondly, the show started at 8:15 pm."
491,Instead of 19:30 p.m.
492,"Thirdly, a theatre restaurant was being closed."
493,But the worst thing is the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
494,It was really a let down!!
495,"How dare you could show ""Your perfect evening out"" in your advertisement."
496,It was very ridiculous!
497,"To be honestly, I would like you could return the money back to me."
498,And explain what had happened.
499,I look forward to hearing from you return back.
500,Thank you for your patience.
501,"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."
502,Although Pat is very smart and intelligent.
503,She likes to talk with other people.
504,She has an open-mind.
505,"So, she has got many friends."
506,Lily was one of her best friends before for three years.
507,"She enjoyed sharing everything with Pat, whatever it was."
508,Nick was Lily's husband.
509,Her husband was being fired the last previous year.
510,Lily felt very nervous about their financial problems and their future.
511,As they wanted to get a baby.
512,She told to Pat about what had happened in her family.
513,And what she was worried.
514,"Of course, she knew Nick didn't like her to tell other people what about his private."
515,She told Pat that she didn't want any other people to know about it except her.
516,Pat also promised not to tell other people.
517,"But in one gathering party, their friends want to show their concern, and they went to ask about Nick and send him their sympathy."
518,This let Nick very embarrassed and he got felt hurt.
519,"Finally, they got separated."
520,"Today, Pat and Lily are still friends."
521,But Lily never tells her what she really wants and what she really thought about the thing.
522,Pat felt very sorry about that but it was too late.
523,"Dear Sir or Madam,"
524,I am writing to express my great disappointment about the musical show I attended in your theatre last weekend.
525,"According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE, but surprisingly, it was performed by a different actor whom I even didn't know the name."
526,"In addition, the show was supposed to be started at 19:30 but it was started half an hour later, until 20:15."
527,"To make the matter worse, I had expected the ticket with some discount, but when I went to the ticket box, there was no discount available."
528,The last thing is the theatre restaurant was closed after the show because it only opened until 9 o'clock at night.
529,You can imagine how disappointed I am when spending money on such a terrible evening.
530,I would like you to look into the matter immediately and I insisted on getting some money back.
531,I look forward to receiving a satisfactory reply as soon as possible.
532,"Nowadays, we use a lot of modern technology both at home and in the office but it has its advantage and disadvantages."
533,"The first and most important thing is that modern technology have made our life easier, for instance the ricer cooker is a great invention, all you have to do is putting rice on it and switch it on, it makes cooking more efficiently."
534,"Furthmore, we can use the computer and telephone a lot."
535,"Wherever you are, you can get in touch with people whenever you want."
536,"It is often suggested that, modern technology makes the gap bigger between people, they get used to communicating with the machine then forget how to deal with human beings."
537,"To sum up, I believe that modern technology could help our daily life but we should not always rely on it."
538,"How are you? I have been to the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" in your theatre last week."
539,I have got a few things to complain about regarding your theatre.
540,The first thing is in your note it says that you should have got Danny Brook in the show.
541,"But in the show, there was a another actor."
542,"I was so disappointing, because I came from far away to see Danny Broke."
543,"In the note it also says that the show starts at 19:30, and so I went in at 19:25."
544,"The show was started at 20:15, which means it has wasted one hour of my time."
545,"The note says that there are discounts available on tickets, but I bought my ticket and your people told me that there is no discount for the ticket."
546,When the show is finished.
547,I decided to go and visit your theatre restaurant.
548,But I went there and it is closed for some reason.
549,I was really hungry and I went to other restaurant as soon as I can.
550,"The note says that your perfect evening out, I thought I could get my money back, with your poor service and all my reasons, But it was not ask for money back."
551,I was really disappointed about your theatre and service.
552,I hope I can get my money back and you can improve it.
553,Than you for reading this.
554,"Today, science and technology help us a lot."
555,"In the pass, people have had to go and get wood, make a fire and cook, but now people can cook in a microwave and do not have to do all the hard work."
556,Science and technology can give us a better live lifestyle or better food.
557,"For example, before people had to walk from one place to another, but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol-powered transport vehicles and we can travel with them faster."
558,We also can produce more and better food or by using science and technology.
559,"The original sentence is empty, as there is no content after the letter ""g""."
560,By using science to put all the good parts of two plants into one plant.
561,We can also use technology to produce more food and help them grow faster.
562,Science and technology can also be used to produce some materials.
563,"The original sentence is empty, so the correction is also empty:"
564,"Steel or iron, which are used in our building."
565,They can make it stronger and not easy to destroy.
566,"Science and technology can give us a lot of good things for our daily life, make us easy to do things or work."
567,I would like to point out the problems I encountered when I went to watch your musical show Over the Rainbow at the Circle Theatre.
568,"On your advertisement, you have written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would be performing."
569,"However, I noticed when I was watching it that a different actor was performing."
570,I have had expected Danny Brook to perform and it was extremely disappointing.
571,"Also, the times printed on your advertisement were 14."
572,"I went to the 19:30 show, but it did not start until it was 20:15."
573,I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late.
574,"On your advertisement, it said that discounts were available for the tickets."
575,"However, when I was there to buy a ticket, there were no discounts available."
576,"I was rather thirsty and hungry after the show and on your advertisement, it made a cup of tea and some cakes in your restaurant sound rather inviting."
577,"However, to my disappointment, the restaurant was closed because it was being redecorated."
578,"It was not my perfect evening out, as your advertisement said it would be, and I would like some money back."
579,I hope you would give these problems your immediate attention.
580,"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."
581,"One minute I told her the biggest secret of my life, the next she had told someone all about it."
582,"I trusted her! How could I have been so stupid, so blind as not to see her inability to keep the biggest secret about my biggest crush ever?"
583,"When I overheard girls from other forms gossiping about me and my latest crush, I was furious."
584,"From that day onwards, Pat and I stopped being friends."
585,"I moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school."
586,"Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times."
587,"However I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having, the one problem about my parents getting a divorce."
588,"When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed."
589,"My dad began packing his things the very next day, to move to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers and signing them."
590,That period of my life was one of the worst.
591,"I went into a depression, and no matter who tried to make me feel better, I only felt worse."
592,"However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat."
593,She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days.
594,She told me she had heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help.
595,"When she was comforting me, I noticed she had changed."
596,"She was a person I could turn to, I could trust."
597,"She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do with anyone."
598,"Ever since, she gained my trust and I have told her my feelings and secrets."
599,"Unlike a year ago, she did not tell a soul."
600,"She kept every single one of my secrets well, and not surprisingly, she became my best friend."
601,"Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager."
602,My happiness was short lived.
603,"When I came home from school one day, I received a phone call from Pat's mum, and in a voice chocked with tears she told me that Pat had died in an accident."
604,She had been killed by a speeding car.
605,The news shook me to the very core.
606,"I cried for days straight on end, eating and sleeping very little."
607,"I fell into a deep depression, and took an extremely long time to recover."
608,"I am still missing Pat, but my pain is nearly over now."
609,I could only comfort myself by reminding myself that at least she died knowing I had forgiven her for telling my secret.
610,"Dear Sir or Madam,"

760,So July is the only time I will be free.
761,"Secondly, I would prefer tents to log cabins."
762,Camping is my enthusiasm and I sleep in tents every time I go camping.
763,"Therefore, I am afraid I can't get used to log cabins easily."

783,"Think of the awful crowds, the busy car parks, polluted air in the city centers and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks."
784,I don't think anyone would really like to face them.
785,"But once you get there, they're just inevitable, aren't they?"
786,"Well, now before you go shopping, think again and you'll find out it won't always be enjoyable."
787,"Dear Mr. Helen Ryan,"
788,I am writing to you and reply to answer the answers from your letter.
789,"I was glad to hearing the news from you and thank you very much! When you mentioned the period of my traveling, I'm afraid I am only free in July."
790,"Because I go on holiday in July, naturally, and I have two terms in June and August."
791,"Therefore, I hope that you could make to a suitable argument between you and me."
792,"Furthermore, I would like to stay in log cabins which I could feel are a more American style of accommodation."
793,"In addition, there should not be too hot inside during July."
794,"If I get two choices, I would like to go swimming and take photographs."
795,Because I grew up in my home town that is a seaside city.
796,"I was starting trainning since 1996, and I have never given it up."
797,Especially it is was really good for my health during the growth period.
798,Photography is my hobby that is taken in my spare time.

810,"In my opinion, women are really enjoying shopping."
811,It seems a human activity during their spare time.
812,"However, we are going to change from the traditional system to the ""e-shopping""."
813,It is new for customers by.
814,"With technology, they can switch on the computer and click everything they want."
815,"Therefore, it looks like a service and is also boring for the customer."
816,I think most of gentlemen dislike shopping.
817,They are always waiting for a long time after women finish their shopping.
818,I believed that most busy people want to go shopping by the easy and quick way.
819,Because they don't like waiting for payment and wasting time of life.
820,"Therefore, they would like to use ""e-shopping"", which is getting better for their time."
821,The lifestyle has changed already from the past.
822,Shopping is a common activity in their life.
823,"We must focus on the specific lifestyle, which will make us enjoyable."
824,"In conclusion, I believe that shopping only wastes time for human life."

991,"For example, some people always shop to get food or stuff they need in everyday life."
992,"They won't enjoy this kind of shopping, because it is not getting what they want."

995,"Because there are too many people, it makes you want to stay home and you won't enjoy shopping."

1006,I really wanted to learn how to swim.
1007,I was wondering if there is a coach who could give us a lesson during the Camp.
1008,"Also, I would like to join the basketball team."
1009,Our high school basketball team has won many competitions during the last ten years in our city.

1031,"In addition, due to my height (185 cm), I think cabins may be a better choice."
1032,"Thirdly, from the activity list, I chose swimming and tennis as my favourite ones."

1047,You will experience a different life in them.
1048,"In conclusion, besides all that I mentioned, I highly recommend you video the students' daily life and interview them."
1049,That will definitely make it a successful video.
1050,"I have just received your letter, and I am very happy about this."
1051,"I think I would like to travel only in July because I've just finished my course at that time, and I can have a short holiday in these days."
1052,It will be very nice for me.
1053,"Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins, ."
1054,"I think I prefer both of them, because I've never been there before, and never heard of these two places."
1055,"I am very interested in both places but, I can just choose one place."
1056,"I think I will choose log cabins, it's they sounds good and if I have time, maybe I can go to stay in tents next time (maybe next year)."
1057,...and I went to when I'd a week's holiday in London.</c></NS>
1058,"When I am at Camp, I will choose singing and photography."
1059,"I can sing classic music and pop music, seem like rock & roll."
1060,My mum liked me singing this song.
1061,"And I can also make very good photographs, because I learned to do this in China two years ago."
1062,Another thing is I would like to ask you some questions about the journey stay.
1063,What's the weather like? What kind of clothes shall I take? And how much does it cost per night to stay in a Hotel? Thanks for your help.
1064,Shopping is not always enjoyable.
1065,"A lot of people enjoy shopping very much, me."
1066,But sometimes shopping is not very enjoyable.
1067,"Firstly, I am a student."
1068,"I don't have a job, so, I have to ask for money from my parents."
1069,I can't ask for too much that's.
1070,That's very bad for my parents.
1071,When I go shopping.
1072,Always feel ashamed because I spend my parents' money.
1073,"Although I have got a part-time job, it provides just enough to pay my rent."
1074,"Secondly, if you live in a big city, the things are always expensive."
1075,"You should spend more money on buying clothes and food, you think you will be very happy when you buy it, but when you come back home and take out your purse, you must will feel sad."
1076,"Your purse is nearly empty, (when you don't have enough money."
1077,"Sometimes, when you shop on the street, you will see a lot of things that you like, and you can't buy them once, then you will feel very sad maybe."
1078,"And then, you may save money for the things you like, nothing to do, just for the poor things what you like so funny, isn't it?"
1079,"Another thing is when you shop on a busy street, seem like Oxford St in London."
1080,A lot of thieves are there.
1081,They will steal your money.
1082,"So, in my opinion shopping is not really enjoyable all the time for me."
1083,It will stop when I get a good job.
1084,Maybe I will feel better and enjoy it.
1085,Having won the trip to California delights me and I am providing you with the further information you asked for.
1086,"I only have two months of vacation that are in July and August and since I must visit my grandparents in August, the only time possible is July."
1087,"I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because the Californian summer is hot and dry so, because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a comfortable coolness."
1088,The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing.
1089,I have played basketball during for 5 years in an amateur franchise team and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good.
1090,"On the other hand, I am a complete debutant concerning at surfing."
1091,"This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides, and I believe this is the perfect occasion to introduce myself to this exciting sport."
1092,I still have some questions to ask you.
1093,"Do I need to bring any particular clothing, like a surfing suit or wet suit? Is any ""pocket money"" required in case there is something I need to pay for? And finally, is somebody going to fetch me at the airport or am I supposed to get to the camp on my own and get refunded afterwards?"
1094,"Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money for yourself or people you like is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare."
1095,"You often enter a shop and see people everywhere, so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleys to take a look at a product."
1096,"After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price."
1097,"Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers."
1098,"There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stay up even though your tired legs demand a seat."
1099,It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocrital cashier.
1100,"Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer, but unfortunately, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for."
1101,"Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting in more frustration and tiredness."
1102,So there are several plausible reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable.
1103,Dear Madam Helen Ryan.
1104,I have received your letter yesterday.
1105,I really thank you for your organisation has given me the opportunities.
1106,The original sentence is:
1107,"The Concerning the date that I would like to travel, it will be nice to go on the 1st of July."
1108,Because my summer holidays break is start at the end of June.
1109,And I need a few days to prepare my stuff.
1110,"Regarding to the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in tents more rather than log cabins because I have a lot of experiences of putting up my own tents."
1111,"When I was in high school, I used to be a member of the campfire."
1112,The Concerning the activities that you have listed forms.
1113,"Some of them I am really interested in it, especially painting."
1114,"Since I was young, my dad always took me out to have life drawings, so now it has become one of my hobbies."
1115,"And I think, it is will be nice to draw the beautiful landscapes of the place."
1116,"Beside drawings, swimming is my favourite as well."
1117,"When I was in highschool, I have joined in the swimming club."
1118,And I also participated in a few swimming competition.
1119,"Although I'm not the best, but I have a lot of confidence in it."
1120,"At last there are some of things I need to clarify, that is, what type of clothes and how much money do I need to prepare to bring."
1121,I agree! Sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable.
1122,"For most people might think, why would I say that because shopping is a very good entertainment, especially for females, as like me."
1123,"For frankly, I like to shop."
1124,Of course not because of buying things.
1125,I like to have window shopping that is good to go around the shopping area.
1126,It would help you keeps up to the date.
1127,What fashion is hit in now.
1128,"But when during any peak season, like Christmas, holidays or even during weekends."
1129,Then I can say I'm definitely doesn't feel it is enjoyable.
1130,Because of the crowd.
1131,"For me, I think it is not shopping that is but a kind of suffering."
1132,"Especially especially, queueing up for twenty minutes for just paying or waiting for the salesgirl to get your the right size of clothes."
1133,"So sometimes I don't think shopping is enjoyable, and if there is any big holiday, I would rather stay at home and watch television."
1134,I am so glad that I have won this competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.
1135,I would like to travel in the middle of July because my summer holiday starts in the middle of July.
1136,"Is it possible to travel in July? And also I like to camp in a tent, because it will be more interesting than log cabins."
1137,You need to do everything by yourself.
1138,"Taking a photography during the holiday is a very good memory for me, and I can share my adventures to my friends."
1139,So while I am at the Camp I like to take many photographs and climb a mountain.
1140,"Fresh-air, flowers and meeting some interesting people while you are climbing you have."
1141,"By the way, I wonder if I need a lot of money and what kind of clothes I should bring."
1142,"Finally, thanks for giving this opportunity to me."
1143,I look forward to hearing from you.
1144,Shopping is not always enjoyable.
1145,Shopping sounds very enjoyable and is fantastic for women.
1146,You can find a lot of interesting things which you were unexpected.
1147,"Some people enjoy window shopping, but some people enjoy spending their money on their clothes or shoes."
1148,"Nowadays, in a family, shopping isn't a woman's job."
1149,"In other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card."
1150,"For instance, you wanted to buy everything which you saw, and after that, you don't know how much you have spent."
1151,"If you are going shopping, someone can easily steal your wallet when you are looking at some interesting things."
1152,It will be very awful.
1153,"However, shopping has pros and cons, it."
1154,It depends on personal thinking.
1155,"I enjoy shopping very much, it."
1156,It can let me know what's going on in the world.
1157,"But it is a good idea to have a break during the shopping trip, then you won't feel so tired."
1158,I have safely received your letter bringing the good news.
1159,I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found out that I won the competition.
1160,Here I enclose some information which you requested in the letter I received.
1161,I think that the best and most convenient time for me to travel would be in July.
1162,This is because it falls on my semester holidays and that it is also summer in America.
1163,"This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays, as well as allowing me to gain valuable knowledge and experience."
1164,"Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the."
1165,"It will let me get up and close with nature, and experience life in the wild."
1166,"Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember."
1167,Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do.
1168,"However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best."
1169,I have much experience in swimming and have represented my school before.
1170,"As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons."
1171,"Last but not least, I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America."
1172,"As I have not been there before, I am rather unsure of what to wear."
1173,I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring.
1174,"Will I be going out much, or just staying in Camp California all the time?"
1175,I hope that I haven't taken up too much time.
1176,Thank you for this exciting news.
1177,I can't wait to go on this adventure of a lifetime!
1178,"No errors or corrections needed, as the sentence is already in its original and corrected form."
1179,How are you in London? I hope the weather is holding up.
1180,I hear that it can be terrible at times.

1182,It was a fantastic experience.
1183,The concert was held at our school hall.
1184,"All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work."
1185,I helped to decorate the walls.
1186,"My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green."
1187,"It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result."

1193,This produced a stunning effect during the concert.
1194,I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.
1195,I enjoyed fixing the studio equipment in particular.
1196,It gave me the chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics.
1197,"On the whole, it was a fun experience to work with friends, fixing bulbs, attaching lights and adding speakers."

1200,I look forward to reading what you have to say.
1201,Thank you for your letter.
1202,I'd like to go on holiday for two weeks at Camp California in the U.
1203,"The original sentence is blank, so there is no correction."
1204,I can go only on July because I'm a student.

1206,I want to know if it is available during that time.
1207,"First of all, I would be pleased if the accommodation is in a log cabin because I'm afraid of insects and it's wet in the tent."
1208,It'll make me like at the village.

1217,I look foreword to hearin from you.
1218,Recently we have had a class discussion about shopping.
1219,All of the students agree with that shopping is not always enjoyable.
1220,Women always enjoy shopping.
1221,But a lot of inconvenients annoy them.
1222,So they said they do not always enjoy shopping.
1223,First of all the car parking is not convenient and is expensive.
1224,Sometimes you can't find a place to park your car.
1225,Sometimes you have to park your car in a further place and walk to the supermarket.
1226,"Furthermore, when you look around the supermarket, you can't easily find the goods which you want to buy."
1227,It's very confusing without the right signs.
1228,Sometimes you get lost in the supermarket.
1229,"Otherwise, men always don't like shopping, while."
1230,"While their wives are doing the shopping, they sit in the car or read a newspaper."
1231,They would be happy if there were sports and leisure facilities in the supermarket.
1232,They'll change their mind.
1233,Instead of hating shopping they would enjoy shopping.
1234,"In my opinion, nowadays shopping is not always enjoyable."
1235,Dear Mrs Helen Ryan.
1236,Thank you very much for your letter.
1237,I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition.

1244,I am pretty good at painting.
1245,I have won several prizes in the competitions which were held by my college.
1246,"On the other hand, I started to play tennis at the age of six."
1247,Tennis is my favourate sports event.

1257,Shopping is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays.
1258,"In some people's opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of fun and they can even get satisfaction from it."
1259,"However, more and more people are now asking, ""Is shopping always so enjoyable?"" In my view, the answer is, NO."
1260,"Firstly, since more and more people go shopping, shops are always so crowded, especially the popular ones."
1261,Try to imagine the scene: twenty or thirty or even more people are keeping in a queue outside the fitting room.
1262,Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you want to buy a T-shirt?
1263,"Secondly, the cost is also a problem."
1264,It will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it.
1265,"One of my friend, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105."
1266,Then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money.
1267,"After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop."
1268,But it was just not there! She felt really badly after that.
1269,"So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable?"
1270,More and more people find that there are a lot of nicer things they can do rather than shopping.
1271,Shopping is not always enjoyable.
1272,Sometimes it can be a waste of time.
1273,"So, let's have a new lifestyle in this new generation!"

1283,I think it is great and I want to try it.
1284,I like doing sports.
1285,I would like to play basketball and golf when I am at the Camp.
1286,I play basketball a lot and I am a member of our college term.

1288,And also I want to ask some questions.
1289,What clothes should I taken? How much money should I taken? And how could we meet at the airport? I am looking forward to your reply.
1290,"As our class is going to make a short video about daily life at college, I am writing this report to suggest some lessons and activities which should be filmed."

1299,The library is very important in our daily life.
1300,"Everyday we go to the canteen have lunch, no matter whether you bought food from there or you take your own food."
1301,What do you do after class? Joging or doing some sports? You can't forget football.
1302,These are what I think should be filmed.
1303,"If any of you have other suggestions, we can discuss this again."
1304,But I think these five lessons or activities are the most common in our daily life at college.
1305,I am very glad to hear that I have won the prize and thank you very much about that.
1306,"Here is the information you want, I hope they are useful."
1307,"First of all, July is the only month I can travel, because I have got exams at school and I won't finish them until the last day of June."

1322,But it was a good experience for me because I learnt how to claim calm down and play well in front of the audience at the concert.
1323,"And also I have never played the piano with the singers before, and after that it makes me more confident and has improved my skills a lot."
1324,"When the concert finished, my favourite singer talked to me & they invited me to play the piano in their next concert and they said that because I performed well in that concert."

1348,"I think most people will agree with ""shopping is not always enjoyable""."
1349,"Some people might say women just love shopping, they couldn't stop thinking about doing shopping."
1350,"Yes, it is true, this."
1351,"This is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before, and some women don't earn money."
1352,They have no idea how diffcult it is to earn the money.

1362,I think most men have the same opinion as I do.

1364,"In my eyes they are wasting their lives, they are hopeless."
1365,"Those are only my opinions, you."

1435,"In the future, our homes will have incorporated the most advanced technologies."
1436,"Computers will take an important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because in via the computer we would buy whatever we want."
1437,"Books will gradually disappear, and instead we will read all the things we want in our computer."

1460,"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it."
1461,This story happened two years ago.
1462,"That was a very hot summer, every all the."
1463,"All the people in our city liked to swim in the river, perhaps."
1464,Perhaps they didn't think it was interesting if they swam in the pool.
1465,"Personally, Id like to say I was good at swimming."
1466,"Not only was I a member of the swimming team in our school, but also I had been taught by my father since I was five years old."
1467,So I would have understood if you had a accident.
1468,"One day, I passed by a river in accident."
1469,I saw there were a lot of people playing in the river.
1470,"Suddenly, I heard a cry of ""help"" in my distance."
1471,"In a while, lots of passed-by passersby crowed to the riverside."
1472,"To my surprise, nobody wanted to go in to save that boy who was shouting, but just stood there, like lots of ""champ""."
1473,"I started thinking about it, after."
1474,"After all, either had I never done this task before or trained."
1475,I was just 15 years old.
1476,"Finally, I jumped into the river."
1477,"I really knew that was dangerous, but I haven't think about anything except justify this word."

1484,So we can walk around and see how it looks like in Greenwich.
1485,"All of us want to go on this trip, but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we would all like to go there."
1486,It is from 10 am to 7 pm.
1487,"The original sentence is simply ""m"", which means the learner left out the word ""the"" before the noun ""m""."
1488,"It is about the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles, all."
1489,"All of us are really interested, and it is free for students to get in as well."
1490,"It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design, and we can learn loads of things in there."

1495,"This trip was organised by our form tutor, he."

1497,"The first days were going fine, we."

1499,"In on the second day, we had to climb up a twenty meters hill with our hands."
1500,It was so difficult for me because I was really scared to stand in on a high place since I was young.
1501,I did not want to climb up but I did not have any choice.
1502,"So I started to climb really slow and careful, and I climbed about 15 meters quite successfully, so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away."
1503,"But after I climbed two steps more, my right foot slipped over."
1504,"I was nearly fell down, but luckily my hand caught a rock."
1505,"It was dangerous, but I didn't have any choice, finally."
1506,"Finally, I did it."
1507,No errors or corrections needed for this sentence. It is already in the correct form:
1508,My name is Bao-yu Liao.
1509,I am the representative of our class in your college to write to you.
1510,We are very grateful for what you have well-organized the program going to London for us.
1511,"It is a good programme, especially in particular."
1512,"In particular, the National Art Gallery is one of the most places we would like to visit."
1513,This is because we are very interested in art.
1514,"In fact, some of our classmates have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show."
1515,"Conincidently the show is in London and on Tuesday March 14, which is during the period we are in London for the three-day program."
1516,We think it is a great opportunity because we are very interested in art and fashion.
1517,"Of course, we are interested in leisure as well."
1518,"Therefore, if it is possible, we would like to see the show in the afternoon on 14 March instead of going shopping."
1519,It would be very much appreciated if you could arrange for the programme to be changed.
1520,We look forward to hearing a some good news from you soon.
1521,"Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time."
1522,We know it does not matter whether they are famous or not; everyone has deserved his own privacy.
1523,"However, as human beings, almost all of us are curious."
1524,We like to know and chat about gossip.
1525,This is why gossip magazines are so popular.
1526,"Due to commercial value, journalists have to follow them all the time to peep into their private lives to satisfy us."
1527,"There, it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them."
1528,"However, journalists should not only think about commercial value, but morality and principles are also being concerned."
1529,"Of course, if everyone paid less attention or interest, the situations should be better."
1530,I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died in the car crash was one of the most disaster examples.
1531,Although we cannot deny it is our nature - we are curious - we can improve our sense of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them.
1532,"Actually, I am happy to hear that journalists have learned their lesson from the death of Princess Diana and try to let her children and the Royal family have more privacy."
1533,Lets all leave them more freedom to enjoy their private lives.
1534,"Firstly, I would like to thank you for the program that you provided."
1535,"It was a very good program, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which I am sure the whole class would enjoy."
1536,"However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend."
1537,It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March.
1538,It will be from 10.
1539,"The show will be about all the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles."
1540,We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students.
1541,This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style.
1542,We might also get a change to meet new people and interact with them.
1543,The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change.
1544,I have a few suggestions on how the program could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .
1545,We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon.
1546,We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping.
1547,"We can, however, go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show."
1548,"Lastly, I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show."
1549,I hope you would consider this matter.
1550,I look forward to hearing from you.
1551,"Everyday, something changes and we become more modern companies."
1552,"Companies use computers instead of books, dentists use modernized electric tools instead of just a pair of pliers."
1553,Even homes are affected.
1554,"From letters to emails, from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves, but."
1555,"But we aren't just going to stop here are we? No, in the future, the present will be the past and those things now new to us will be old, outdated and changed."
1556,I see a very different home for us in the future.
1557,Most things will be computerized.
1558,We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys.
1559,We can turn on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers.
1560,We might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room.
1561,Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door.
1562,Although all that may change our houses may be still the same.
1563,The rooms and sizes should remain as it was and the living rooms and everything may still be decorated in the same style.
1564,We might still favour that old carpet and couch.
1565,The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too.
1566,"In the future, every child might have a laptop."
1567,"And instead of going to school, why not let school come to you? We will be learning at home using computers and discs."
1568,They never have to leave the house or wake up so early.
1569,Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilities we will be using.
1570,"We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot, a machine, or something else with the same purpose."
1571,"Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen, it."
1572,It will still be filled with vegetables and meat.
1573,This is because people won't give up the great taste of food although.
1574,Although it could be substituted to with a vitamin pill or two.
1575,"Lastly, I think that all these changes won't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptedly."
1576,People will be able to adjust and change with the times.
1577,I wanted to thank you for allowing us to have this great opportunity to visiting London.
1578,"I have read the program and I find it very appealing, especially because of the River trip to Greenwich."
1579,"However, I have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and I was wondering if we could visit it."
1580,The show is going to be at the Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March from 10.
1581,"The original sentence is empty, as there are no words or punctuation marks in the provided tagged sentence."
1582,"There will be shown the latest fashions, leisure and sportswear, some make up and also different hairstyles."
1583,The students are admitted free so we won't have to pay for the visit.
1584,We all think this is a great opportunity to learn more about daily London life and what people like to wear.
1585,I suggest visiting the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday morning and visiting the Science Museum on Friday afternoon.
1586,We all hope you would consider our suggestion.
1587,Almost everyone hates other people gossiping in about their private lives.
1588,It's a natural reaction to be angry with somebody you don't trust for gossiping about you and bothering your personal thoughts.
1589,"So I think famous people, no matter if they are politicians or film stars, don't deserve to be followed by journalists every time they are trying to have a good time."
1590,"I think that journalists only aim is money, because they know that if they publish famous people's private lives, they will earn lots of money selling the magazine or the newspaper."
1591,But they don't consider the problems the rumors may bring to the famous family or couple.
1592,Sometimes the journalist's aim isn't the money: there are some journalists who may try to spoil a politician's or film star's career only because they are jealous.
1593,"In conclusion, no matter which or what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do."
1594,"I am writing to you about your advertisement about the ""London Fashion"" and ""Leisure Show""."
1595,"Thank you for organizing this good program, especially the Leisure show, which is very interesting to us."
1596,So all of our class would like to go to the show during their three days in London.
1597,But there is a problem which I hope you can solve.
1598,"According to your advertisement, we were pleased to learn that we can do some different activities in London, which included sightseeing by bus, a River trip to Greenwich, visiting the Science Museum and National Art Gallery and so on."
1599,"The point is, The London Fashion and Leisure show will be fantastic."
1600,"From these, we can see the latest fashion, imaginative make up and hairstyles."
1601,"What is more, they are the Leisure and sports wear, which we are keen on seeing it."
1602,"In your advertisement, you had written ""The show will be held in the Central Exhibition hall in London."
1603,It starts from 10 am to 7 pm on 14th March.
1604,I think it is a great opportunity because I am sure we will enjoy ourselves.
1605,"But I wonder if the timetable could change, which would be perfect."
1606,"As you know, all of us want to join the program, so if some students go to the Science Museum, they will miss the wonderful show."
1607,"For that reason, I suggest that you could change the activities."
1608,"In my opinion, we had better go to the show instead of the science museum and shopping."
1609,"Also we can go to the Science Museum on 15th March, which instead of having some free time in the afternoon."
1610,I am sorry to make you inconvenient.
1611,I hope it doesn't make cause some trouble if you accept my suggestion.
1612,I look forward to receiving your apply reply as soon as possible.
1613,"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it."
1614,"Last night, when I went into my house it was quite silent."
1615,I felt there might be something that has gone wrong.
1616,I found my parents sitting in an armchair.
1617,I could see sadness in my father's eyes.
1618,"My mother came over to me and said softly; ""My dear, your father's company has just gone bankrupt"", then she couldn't help crying."
1619,"When I heard this bad news, I was very depressed because father worked quite hard for his company."
1620,"My father always remembered his responsibility was giving to provide a good salary to his workers, which is the aim of his life."
1621,So I must find out a solution which can help to help my great father.
1622,"One day, I suddenly got a good idea."
1623,Why not go to the sock stock exchange? I said to myself.
1624,"Almost every day I stayed in there and researched the exchange decline-line, which gave me lots of information from there."
1625,"Finally, I decided to join in the dangerous game, which will meant losing everything or suddenly becoming a millionaire."
1626,"With luck, I was won by chance."
1627,"When I went home, I found my parents were standing at the door looking very cheerful."
1628,Surely it doesn't mean that they have learnt the exciting news? I said to myself again.
1629,"Much to my surprise, they told me in high voice that they never went bankrupt."
1630,They wanted to give me an opportunity to do something impressive by myself.
1631,"Now, they are both proud of me!"
1632,"I would like first, in the name of my whole class, to thank you for all you've done for us and for our trip to London."
1633,"We've just been told about your program and I must say that we all like it! What I am most looking forward to is the River trip to Greenwich; but I would also really like to visit the Science Museum as well as the National Gallery! This will be very enriching for us! You must wonder why I'm writing to you, them."
1634,"Well actually we've just received an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and the vast majority of the class would like to go and see it."
1635,This will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March.
1636,"We thought it would be a great experience for us since we quite don't have such opportunities in our everyday life! Moreover, the entrance admission is free for the students so that won't raise the cost of the trip."
1637,"I thought we should visit the Science Museum on Monday afternoon so that we could do the River trip on Tuesday morning just before going to the fashion show! Anyway, we were going shopping on Tuesday afternoon so that won't be a problem to my mind."
1638,I hope you will take account of our request.
1639,It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it.
1640,George was about to be lynched on account of his skin.
1641,Someone had to react.
1642,I had to react!
1643,"Otherwise I would have felt responsible for his death, for the rest of my life."
1644,"George was lying on the floor, surrounded by his own lake of blood."
1645,He had just been beaten by a group of white men.
1646,"And yet, he was too weak to resist the rats coming from everywhere and eating his face, his legs and his arms, waiting with great impatience for his death."
1647,He had been chained and no way could he escape from his fate without some help! The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisoner.
1648,No one was guarding him.
1649,They were all celebrating their victory with a gorgeous dinner around the fire place.
1650,"I tiptoed as far as the house, carefully opened the door, and headed to George."
1651,"At the very moment when he says me, his eyes began to shine and I could feel that he had recovered some hope."
1652,"I delivered him and we were about to flee, taking back our dignity and freedom overwhelmed with joy, when we saw a white man, aiming his gun at us."
1653,"Firstly, I am being the representative of my class to thank you for organizing a good program in London, especially the visiting of the Science Museum and National Art Gallery."
1654,We know that it is a good chance for us to learn more different things and we can widen our knowledge in the Science Museum.
1655,"In addition, we can appreciate and enjoy the art in the National Art Gallery."
1656,"Unfortunately, I know that most of the students have already visited these two places before."
1657,So we decided to choose another program which have seen as an entertainment.
1658,It is the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW.
1659,"The show is will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall, London."
1660,"The date is on Tuesday March 14, from 10."
1661,"The original sentence is blank, as the learner did not include any text for that position. The correction is also blank, as there is no text to correct in this case."
1662,"It shows the latest fashions, including leisure and sports wear."
1663,"In spite of these, there is also make up and hairstyles, which attract girls most."
1664,"Secondly, the show is a great opportunity because it holds for only 1 day, which is Tuesday March 14."
1665,"And, it is free for students."
1666,So I think it is worth visiting.
1667,"Personally, here is my some suggestions about how the program could be changed."
1668,We can join the program that you planned as usual and then we go to that fashion show on Tuesday.
1669,"Finally, the above information is my opinion and I hope you can accept it."
1670,Thanks for your kind attention.
1671,"How is the home of the future will be? Remain the same, as usual, or have a great difference?"
1672,"For me, I think people's homes may not be built on the ground."
1673,The homes will be built on in the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings.
1674,As the homes is built on in the sky.
1675,It will save a lot of electricity as solar energy is used.
1676,And there should be an electrical robotic servant in everyone's home.
1677,So there's no need for people to do the household work.
1678,There should be no beds at home because some pills are invented to make people not become sleepy.
1679,"If you're tired, the pill can give you vitamins, proteins and make you refreshed."
1680,...which I went to when I'd a week's holiday in London.</c></NS>
1681,"For electrical goods, there will be no kind of electrical product except computer."
1682,"People will do anything on the computer, including watching TV, listening to music, and chatting with people."
1683,As the computer is being as a multi-functional product.
1684,"On the other hand, there're some ways that remain the same."
1685,The toilet should remain the same as people need to use it daily and nothing can replace it.
1686,"Second, there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joyful."
1687,"Since friends and family members won't change, by anything."
1688,These are my imagination.
1689,I really wonder how the home of the future will be.
1690,It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thank you for organizing a school trip to London.
1691,We have seen the program list and we all think it will be enjoyable.
1692,Especially to the science museum because we are all doing science in school.
1693,"Recently, some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London."
1694,It will be on the 14th and we all want to go.
1695,"So, it would be greatful if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show."
1696,This is a great opportunity to learn something else because most of us have not been to this kind of show And it is free for students.
1697,It will be incredible if we have a chance to watch the show.
1698,So could you give us permission to go?
1699,We also can suggest how the originally program can be changed.
1700,We will have free time on Wednesday afternoon.
1701,So we can do shopping instead.
1702,"Then, we can go to the show during that period."
1703,...and I went to when I'd a week's holiday in London.</c></NS>
1704,We are all looking forward for you answer.
1705,"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it."
1706,Because there was a man who had had a serious car accident and I was walking past him.
1707,Nobody had noticed him because it happened at night and the car had actually crashed into the bushes.
1708,"I was thinking ""what should I do?"" I haven't got my mobile phone with me and I was half way between my school and home."
1709,At that time he was unconscious.
1710,I kept asking myself should I wake him up or try to use my dubious first aid skills to deal with him.
1711,"I was struggling because I knew if I didn't help him, he would die in a short time."
1712,"I decided to do something for this man, my."
1713,My first move was to check whether there was any solid or liquid which could have blocked his airways.
1714,And I checked his body condition.
1715,After that I turned on the car's lights in order to tell the passing cars.
1716,I ran back home for help.
1717,I phoned to the police And told them the whole story.
1718,The strange thing happened to me when I got back to that man.
1719,The car and the man were not there anymore.
1720,Where could they be? I was wondering.
1721,"Oh, sorry they were not on this road."
1722,They were in on the next road.
1723,"Dear Mrs Smith, Hello Maria."
1724,In this letter you will get all the information that you need.
1725,The hotel that group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel (In on the Victoria road)
1726,And you can take the Bus in front of the hotel to go to the College.
1727,It is four bus stops away.
1728,"Then walk straight for five minutes, you."
1729,You will see the college.
1730,"After the party, we will go to an entertainment area to have fun and we will eat in McDonald's."
1731,The rest you already knows.
1732,I suggest to wear shirts and jeans.
1733,"And the last three hours before you return, we can go to the ""Imax"" cinema to watch a 3-D film! Afterwards we will eat in the KFC."
1734,Then we all take you and the students to the airport.
1735,Madrid is a big city and have many interesting places.
1736,"But the best place for me is ""La Vaguada""."
1737,An entertainment and commercial building.
1738,"In there, students can have fun in the recreation areas, can watch a film and eat all kinds of food and go shopping."
1739,We can have fun well.
1740,And that's why I recommend this place to you.
1741,The building itself is a large building.
1742,It is very safe as there are policemen and cameras.
1743,The building seems to be very new but it is quite old.
1744,"People love this place and called it ""Madrid-two""."
1745,"Around it, there are many restaurants and shops as the building brings a lot of people."
1746,"Inside, there are fast-food restaurants and shops as well."
1747,And it is easy to come to.
1748,Just take the 83 bus or the sub-way.
1749,"In here, you can find everything that you want."
1750,Hope you like it.
1751,"Thank you for your letter, which arrived on the second."

1759,"On our most idyllic playing field, which is over looking the endless countryside and farms."
1760,We can move to our student hall to have a disco dance until 10:00pm.
1761,"On the last day, we have arranged a small party in the hotel, then."
1762,Then we all set off to have a sightseeing tour of Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for the airport.
1763,Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping center in South East London.
1764,There are many historical buildings remain.
1765,I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing tour.
1766,"If any further discussion, please let me know."
1767,"We need light every day, not just at night time."
1768,We need lamp light in offices or and schools or some other places during the day time.
1769,How is the wonderful life after since the invention of electric light.
1770,Here we just talk about the light we invented apart from natural light.
1771,"When I was small, we lived in country yard."
1772,"I remember, we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipping in the oil in the small bottle and made it burned the tip of the cotton string to give us light during the night time."
1773,"It was gave very little light on, and there were many things we couldn't do under the light from the oil lamps because the light range was very small."
1774,"There was no light outside our house, and no light on the road or field either."
1775,I was always very scared whenever or wherever I was.
1776,"Covered by dark, dark and dark."
1777,This scaring dark is still affecting my life now.
1778,I never stayed out after dark today except accompanying by my family.
1779,"What a biggest person on the earth, who invented the light, Einstein was."
1780,"He created another day after sunset, people."
1781,People use it to do anything they want to do.
1782,"We believe we can't live without light today, especially in the city life."
1783,We have a long time to spend on our activities after the Sun goes to bed.
1784,Which we definitely need light to keep on.
1785,"I dare to say, without light, our life will go into a dark, dark hell."
1786,I am writing to reply to your letter you wrote to me on 10 June.
1787,"Firstly, I would like to tell you that the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which locates beside the congress house in the center."
1788,You can make contact with Mrs Brackenbury using the number 06 8793888.

1790,The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening.
1791,"Of course there's also a number 8 bus in front of the hotel, which is also suitable, but it leaves only every half an hour."
1792,"The end-of-conference party, which happens in the evening on 20 June, is going to be held on the coast."
1793,"Beside the barbecue, there are some well-known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night."
1794,"What's more is, that there's a Latin music band coming to make the party more colourful."
1795,"It plays from 10:00 to 11:00, while the students can enjoy it with dancing."
1796,The main events of the party will end up at about 12:30 in the night.
1797,"As you see, what to wear is just something casual."
1798,"Finally, in on the last afternoon, we could visit the museums and markets (we have a very interesting robot-market)."
1799,Basically it's a free time for the students to look round here by themselves.

1805,"First of all, the efficiency of the society has been improved."
1806,"When shopping, we don't need to wait for the cashier to take every article's note by hand."
1807,"When booking an airline flight, we can just simply make a phone call to any agency, and get it done in one minute."
1808,"Secondly, instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need, we can very easily search for it from now on from the internet or on the local network."
1809,"It's often heard that someone, who has a special illness, gets an operation by a foreign institute which he finds via the internet."
1810,"Moreover, with computer networks, it can be possible that people work from home, making projects, controlling operations or having conferences."
1811,Lastly the way of communications has been changed.
1812,"Instead of the traditional telecommunication, we can talk by, mail or even see each other with the help of a computer network."
1813,Of course there're also some aspects in which the computer technology needs to be improved.
1814,"For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as reading on papers."
1815,A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security.
1816,"Till now, to completely rely on computers is still somehow not safe enough."
1817,"In conclusion, computers have become a very essential necessity in our life, and it's still a young invention, which needs to be improved."
1818,Thank you for your letter.

1861,"I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some doubts, please do not hesitate to contact us."
1862,I look foreword to hearing from you.
1863,"Nowadays, our lives is becoming better and better."
1864,Lots of great inventions have been invented in order to make people live comfortably.
1865,"If you ask me which is the greatest invention of all, I will say that it is the television."
1866,"""Televisions is just an amazing invention."""
1867,"""My good friend said that"""
1868,I agree with her.
1869,"Firstly, televisions make us know more about the world without travelling it all."
1870,"If there were no televisions, we wouldn't know what the other countries were like, or even what language they speak, unless we went to that country."
1871,"Secondly, for in some ways, it can educate young children."
1872,"Many TV programmes are especially made for children, such as ""Learn Follow Me"" and ""Be Good to Others""."
1873,"Actually, they are quite good programs and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child."
1874,"The last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainments."
1875,"Maybe you will think that playing basketball, and going to cinemas and discos are much better than staying at home sitting in front of an object."
1876,"However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't."
1877,"If sometimes I don't want to go out and I don't want to be lonely, that's easy, I just turn on the television and enjoy myself."
1878,"However, everything has its advantages and disadvantages."
1879,"Personally, I do think televisions is the most important invention."
1880,Thank you for your letter.
1881,I will try my best to answer the questions.

1883,"It is a modern hotel, near our college, and it is also very convenient to come from the airport."

1887,"This is just a relaxing party, just for so the members have a chance to relax and make friends."
1888,So I think you'd better to wear a dress.
1889,"Finally, about the three free hours, my personal preference is to go shopping."
1890,"Our city has got the biggest shopping centre in South England, there."
1891,There gathers so many shops.
1892,It is worth spending time and money on that.
1893,I look forword to seeing you!
1894,Nowadays people have become used to watching television's programs everyday.
1895,"The TV is so important that you can see it in every family, and it is an essential item for everyone."
1896,"First of all, in my opinion, TV has great educational functions, and it also makes the world become smaller."
1897,You can just sit at home then and you can know what is happening all over the world at that moment.
1898,I would rather watch the news on TV instead of reading a newspaper or listening to it on the radio because the news on TV are vivid.
1899,"Moreover, the TV is a great company for the people who live alone or feel alone."
1900,I would like to open the TV when I stay at home.
1901,"Someone are talking, laughing, crying on there, so join them."
1902,You will feel much better than just by yourself.
1903,Some TV programs are enjoyable!
1904,"However, TV also has some disadvantages."
1905,"You might just sit in front of the TV for hours learning nothing, or no longer talk with your family."
1906,I think this is the worst influence in the society.
1907,"In conclusion, the TV has both advantages and disadvantages, but on the whole the advantages are greater than the disadvantages."
1908,"So, but on the whole, TV still is a wonderful and important invention on the world."
1909,I was very pleased to receive your letter.
