'I couldn't understand how they could be really related to us if I had never even heard of them.'
"I don't expect you know, but things here are very different from what they were five years ago."
No one will connect it to my nanotech research.
"As he listened to the solemn, sacred music, Wang Miao once again felt that the universe had shrunk until it was the size of an empty church."
"'Well, after today's game, I met this . . . little eunuch, who stood in my way and asked me to give him some of my winnings."
Wang Qiyao took pity on the cousin and tried to smooth things over.
"In Yangzhou he'd seen all sorts of plays, but the eunuchs on stage were never dressed anything like Old Hai, or his new gambling friend Wu."
People were so afraid of this kind of damaged-goods behavior in broad daylight that they didn't even dare talk about it.
Every soft word she uttered was swallowed up by the rough walls of the carriage and the heavy curtain before her.
"And so, that very evening, the matter was settled."
I've got to go to His Majesty's Upper Library!'
"I've got company now, and besides, I don't feel in the mood to tell you.'"
"Qin-shi was surprised to hear Bao-yu call out her childhood name in his sleep, but did not like to pursue the matter."
"Standing under the flashing dome of the night sky, Wang suddenly felt the universe shrink until it was so small that only he was imprisoned in it."
"When a glimmer of light appeared in the eastern sky, he parked and walked around aimlessly."
By this time Grannie Liu was already down on her knees and had touched her head several times to the floor in reverence to her 'Aunt Feng'.
"She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one."
Occasionally he would come over to see her.
"Suddenly she felt feverish, and the tremors worked their way from her knees up through her body."
"My word is my wand!' cried Trinket, and Misty burst out laughing."
'Nobody passes without paying a toll!'
'What was the little fellow's name?
"He struck the figure first on the chest with one fist, then reached forward with both hands and grappled it by the waist, forcing it to the ground."
"'She has come all this way today to pay her respects,' she concluded."
"The two girls were left straggling behind, holding hands, trying their best to keep up."
They had no choice but to stand off to one side and wait idly.
How do you get to that place?
"Most were fixed, but a few flickered or moved."
Tomorrow I'll get a proper grip on him.
She ripped the tart-smelling veil away from her face and laid it on her knees.
"He was so near she could have touched the pale, taut skin of his shaved head with her toe."
"For example, others believed that Chen Qingyang had slept with me and that proved my existence."
"'He was bigger than me, and stronger."
But I hope that you will explain the truth to me when you feel the time is right.
"They sat on opposite sides of the classroom, but, though their eyes never met, they could always feel one another's' presence."
"'Well, if it's as you say, Grannie, and being as you've already seen this lady, why not go there yourself and spy out the land for us?'"
"However, the lowland on the back slope of the deserted mountain was crisscrossed with gullies and ditches; and fragrant grass grew lush in the sparse woods."
You'd better bring three taels yourself!'
"He told them to wait a little while, and then he would take them to watch a special effects shoot that was going on at one of the other sets!"
'I've come to see Old Zhou that used to be in service with Her Ladyship before she married.
Then someone would rush onto the stage and bind her into the loops of a five-petal knot with thin hemp twine.
'I wonder where they get the food from?
"When the lights came back on, everything seemed different."
"'Drag me in or drag me out, it's all the same to me . . .'"
The bearers stopped rocking the chair and calmed the raging sea.
Misty went flying over his head and landed widi a crash on the ground.
Her beauty highlighted Wu Peizhen's unattractive appearance; her meticulousness highlighted Wu Peizhen's lack of care; her magnanimity highlighted Wu Peizhen's indebtedness.
"Never!' protested Trinket, but when he tried to straighten himself up and get to his feet, he felt a sudden numbness in the small of his back."
"As they ascended the steps to the main reception room, a little maid lifted up the red carpet which served as a portiere for them to enter."
"In no time she was talking about organizing press conferences for Wang Qiyao, who regretted telling her friend about the screen test."
She also said the military deputy was a jerk.
"So to make peace, she softened her tone and said, ""Anyway, he is breathtakingly ugly—don't you agree?"""
Which of the Goong-goongs do you work for?'
"I used to believe that Chen Qingyang would come to see me immediately after I went up the mountain, but I was wrong."
"By rights, of course, Callers and Visitors has nothing to do with me."
She got used to it after a while.
I told him that I might not be able to return them.
Meanwhile he could hear noisy munching coming from the table above him.
I could just stand in front of people and do a self-criticism.
The city at night gradually recovered the reality of visible light.
"""I want to see the overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background."""
She could not make out the woman's features; all she could see was her head of disheveled hair strewn out along the foot of the bed.
He was reminded of the giant pendulums in Three Body.
"Misty gave a great cry of delight, leapt forwards, and planted himself astride Trinket's back."
So from beginning to end it was just my solo performance.
"A few times, when Wu Peizhen's cousin was not in the studio, they even went straight to look for the director."
"'You know what the old saying is, ""He who helps others helps himself."""
'Did you take in what I said just now?' growled Old Hai.
"But if anyone has important business, bring them in and I will deal with it now.'"
"After a while, the boy moved across and started attacking one of the oxhide cut-outs."
"The musicians reached into their belts, took out the strings of copper coins Great-Granddad had given them, and tossed these at the man's feet."
Suddenly her face flushed and she gave a little laugh: 'It doesn't matter.
"He asked the old eunuch at once: 'Goong-goong, if you want me to go stealing books from the Upper Library, there's just one problem.'"
What was it he sent us for?
Only then did Wu Peizhen cool down a bit.
"Yet if she did not speak up now, what would have been the purpose of her visit?"
"The military deputy had a talk with me, asking me to write a confession."
Wasn't that sufficient reason to be pleased?
"He is trying to be nice to us!"""
"But I just stared at him, like a wild boar, like an idiot, like a male cat staring at a female one, until his anger vanished under my stare."
He had studied abroad and was also a screenwriter; in fact he had written and directed the scene they had earlier seen being filmed.
"The boy leapt astride him, pinned his head to the floor, and cried: 'Well!"
In actual fact he'd won twenty and lent twelve to Wu: the remaining eight he wished to hang on to.
"After I got to the desolate mountainside, Chen Qingyang didn't come to see me right away."
"Chen Qingyang told him that since everyone said he didn't exist, maybe he didn't."
'Let them leave it until this evening.
"In actual fact, when Old Hai had spoken of stealing a book, Trinket's heart had sunk."
"'Stop her, Zhou dear !' said Xi-feng in alarm."
"In the distance, the red star atop the Beijing Exhibition Center's Russian-style spire reflected the light from the cars passing below, also twinkling randomly...."
"Yet, when she shared her anxieties with her parents, Great-Granddad hemmed and hawed, while Great-Grandma scolded the girlfriends, accusing them of sour grapes."
"And from her student, Wang finally learned about her life."
"He got up, grabbed a pitchfork, and tried to stab me, but somebody stopped him."
"""I think it might happen around one o'clock A.M."""
Wang could tell from the one-sided conversation that he was trying to get in touch with the Ürümqi radio astronomy observatory.
Who stole your chickens and dogs?
"'That's where she lives,' he said, pointing in the direction of a side wall."
"Compared to the idea of the universe flickering, he would prefer a supernatural saboteur."
"'I hadn't anything particular in mind,' said Grannie Liu."
"Wang Qiyao naturally did not take him too seriously, but she did kind of like being compared to Ruan Lingyu."
The man shrieked in pain; blood trickled from his nose.
"'Excellent kungfu!' cried his opponent, grappling him with both arms, and delivering a swinging kick with his left foot."
"But when the man asked where they went to school, the cousin was stumped and Wu Peizhen had to answer for herself."
"She watched them do take after take without getting bored, the whole time exclaiming how much fun it was."
We must try and catch her then.
"He heaved a sigh of relief, and put the pancake in his mouth."
"Trinket was delighted, and without bothering to fill his bowl with rice, he attacked a dish of stewed meat."
"The man flashed them a smile, revealing a set of white teeth that shimmered in the darkness of the studio."
"Grandma could hear the shh-shh of rustling sorghum, one wave close upon another, carrying the sound off into the distance."
"""I'm not interfering in your work, am I?"""
My words still echoed in her ears.
Misty had beaten him to it!
"The boots reached the door, and came on into the room."
"Before their visit all of those anecdotes seemed real, but once they had seen the place everything was now entirely unreliable."
"When I came back from herding buffalo in the evening, the team leader accused me of beating peasants, saying that he was going to call a meeting to denounce me."
A dark-red patterned curtain hung from brass hooks over the doorway.
The bright lights of the city penetrated the translucent walls of the immense glass building and dimly revealed its internal structure.
"Since I couldn't imagine these things, they must be evidence of my existence."
Wang tried to interpret the flickers as Morse code.
"In addition to a wok, bowls, a basin, and ladle, there was enough food for two of us to eat for an entire month."
"Conceiving an admiration for the power and prestige of this greater namesake, he had sought to link his family with the latter's clan by becoming his adoptive nephew."
I'm going to fight him tomorrow!
"Her initial hopes may have been dampened, but the anxiety that came with anticipation had been relieved."
Wang Qiyao was to play a bride in a traditional wedding ceremony.
We can let you have it back again as soon as he has gone.'
"When he heard this, Luo Xiaosi couldn't help crying."
From then on the film studio became a place for frequent visits.
Sha was excited to see Wang.
"She was aware of everything going on around her, down to the shouts of ""Camera"" coming from the adjacent set."
"'Little bride, if you let Shan Bianlang touch you, your skin will rot away!'"
Grandma stood confidently; lightning crackled in the clouds overhead and shattered her radiant smile into a million shifting shards.
She's a bit too strict with those beneath her.'
"When I came back from herding buffalo in the evening, the team leader accused me of beating peasants, saying that he was going to call a meeting to denounce me."
"'Bless you, my dear, for being such a help!' said Grannie Liu."
Aroma had always been an intelligent girl.
They didn't say anything about someone getting caught when we were gambling . . .
"I've got an eighty-year-old mother at home, and this is the only way I can make a living.'"
I must tell you that the weeping of women from Northeast Gaomi Township makes beautiful music.
"In that khaki uniform of his, with its copper buttons, he came across as a bit flashy."
"Chen Qingyang said she couldn't believe it: I actually had the impudence to display my ugly male organ in front of her, without feeling the least embarrassed."
The 'stealing' part was no problem; it was the 'book' part that presented what seemed at first like an insurmountable obstacle.
"You were lucky just now, that's all!'"
A classmate asked them where they were off to.
"The food was cold, but he was hungry, and to him it was indescribably delicious."
"What he saw was a boy of fourteen or fifteen, in a short gown, punching at one of the bags that hung from the beam."
"His curiosity aroused, Trinket poked his head out from under the table."
Sha wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead and nodded.
Sha Ruishan's job was to create a more detailed map of the cosmic microwave background using observational data.
They say that now she's getting on in years she's grown even more charitable and given to good works than she was as a girl.
"Unable to overcome her curiosity, Chen Qingyang finally dropped everything and went up the mountain to look for me."
"If you want to see it show the kind of fluctuation observable by the naked eye, you might have to wait until long after the death of the sun."""
"She could make out the shapes of the bearers' statuesque legs poking out from under loose black satin trousers and their big, fleshy feet encased in straw sandals."
Wu Peizhen really could not have cared less about him; the only reason she kept him around was for Wang Qiyao.
Her silent prayer made her delicate lips tremble.
"I don't need you to teach me, either."
"'Well then, don't sit around doing nothing."
"You see, we each have our own jobs here."
"After what seemed an eternity, Wu Peizhen's cousin finally stopped and had them stand off to one side—he had to go to work."
I could have defended myself by saying I didn't have a love affair.
"If he gets me on the ground again tomorrow, I'll die of shame!"
What's the sense in rampaging around here at home when you could go out and help yourself?'
"""Especially for it to happen during those years—absolutely incredible."""
She knew that any of those paths would take her to me.
"She even cried in public and declared that if I didn't recover, she would take care of me all her life."
"Her beauty will be buried and lost to the world, he said to himself."
Did you catch us in the act?
That's when you find a way to steal the book . . .'
"From deep in the sorghum came the melancholy croaks of toads, the dreary chirps of grasshoppers, and the plaintive howls of foxes."
The bright lights of the city penetrated the translucent walls of the immense glass building and dimly revealed its internal structure.
"Until my twenty-first birthday I was a virgin, but that night I lured Chen Qingyang up the mountain with me."
'It's hard times that keeps us away.
"If you could take us to see her, that would be very nice; but if that's not possible, perhaps we could trouble you just to give her our regards.'"
One of the four men bearing Grandma's sedan chair that day would eventually become my granddad – it was Commander Yu Zhan'ao.
To simultaneously alter the data from three satellites and an observatory on Earth?
"The domed ceiling was hidden by the flashing red light of the background radiation, and he was an ant crawling through the cracks in the floor."
"'Were you just passing by, or have you come specially?'"
"The highwayman began pushing her into the sorghum field, his hand never leaving the object at his belt."
He had studied abroad and was also a screenwriter; in fact he had written and directed the scene they had earlier seen being filmed.
The lights turned on and off.
"Turning her face away, she said, ""What I mean is, you should show the guy some respect."
"After editing and postproduction, only the pure essence would remain."
"Misty gave a great cry of delight, leapt forwards, and planted himself astride Trinket's back."
A number of important-looking gentlemen sat in the gateway sunning their bellies and discoursing with animated gestures on a wide variety of topics.
"The bedroom set seemed to be further away, but the scene became even more alive."
"The line's color became red, like a snake awakening after hibernation, wriggling as its skin refilled with blood."
The dignity of a specialist did not allow Sha to express too much interest in a request that clearly went against his professional knowledge.
They say throwing up in the bridal chair means a lifetime of bad luck. . . .
"The song was ""Come, Gracious Spirit, Heavenly Dove."""
It was a day of freedom for them.
She turned to Zhou Rui's wife.
The first thing she said was: Don't worry.
I really wanted to prove that I didn't exist then.
His arms were sore and limp with exhaustion.
"Then, bawling over the wall, 'Mrs Zhou, there's an old woman come to see you!'"
"The set lights went dim, the crimson veil went back over her head, and they took it once more from the top."
"But Wang Qiyao's decision to befriend Wu Peizhen meant, in some way, that she was pushing a heavy load onto Wu Peizhen's shoulders."
I don't know where he's from.'
At first she did not want to tell Wu Peizhen about it.
"Xi-feng, however, sipped very intently from her teacup and mused for a while, saying nothing."
She wondered: Could my big chance really come this easily?
"This way, visitors can put on the glasses at night and observe the cosmic microwave background on their own."
"A smile creased her face, and the man pulled his hand away as though it had been scalded."
These were things I didn't want to hear.
The red light had come from more than ten billion years ago.
I must tell you that the weeping of women from Northeast Gaomi Township makes beautiful music.
"Eager to marry, she heard innuendos from her girlfriends that the Shan boy was afflicted with leprosy, and her dreams began to evaporate."
I was the only one left feeding those pigs.
"And then again, of course, though we may look thriving enough from the outside, people don't realize that being a big establishment like ours carries its own difficulties."
"Gou-er's cupidity, however, had been aroused by the words of his mother-in-law, and his reaction to them was less discouraging than his wife's."
"The strange thing was that this scene did not appear terrifying or foreboding, only annoyingly familiar."
"With growing excitement, Grandma stared fearlessly at the green waves raised by the black winds."
"The impression the film studio left on Wang Qiyao, on the other hand, was much more complicated."
"It was a good thing that Wu Peizhen could take it; after all, the weight of everyday living did not rest as heavily on her."
"At three o'clock in the afternoon, the Shanghai boulevards were suffused with weariness, preparing to sign out and change shifts."
"She leaned back languidly in her chair and said, That's a great idea."
"Yet if she did not speak up now, what would have been the purpose of her visit?"
Wu came to fetch him again the following morning.
"He didn't dare to take a bite out of it, but softened it with his saliva, and then swallowed it silently down."
Zhou Rui's wife came hurrying out and asked who it was.
The young man who shared the shack with her cousin asked her in.
That was what happened in the morning.
Or maybe it signals the end of the whole world.
Wu Peizhen went to the address in Qijiabing in search of her cousin.
I could just stand in front of people and do a self-criticism.
"But his eyes roamed, trying to capture other sights."
The whole thing was just unbelievable.
"So I asked her if she hadn't felt like doing it, why had she agreed?"
'Then get up ... and fight!'
Chen Qingyang arrived at my thatched hut precisely at that moment and caught sight of me sitting naked on the bamboo bed.
She therefore embraced her son-in-law's invitation with alacrity and threw herself enthusiastically into the business of helping the young couple to make a living.
"After I got to the desolate mountainside, Chen Qingyang didn't come to see me right away."
I was the only one left feeding those pigs.
"This was also what Wang Qiyao thought at first, but once she reached that stage everything changed."
"That's the sort of person a lady like that calls ""nephew"" ."
I waited for a long time and then decided to give up.
"First, when you met her, you couldn't get a word out; then, when you did start talking, it was all ""your nephew"" this and ""your nephew"" that!"
"Afterward, she said she had fallen deep into sin and karma would catch up with her sooner or later."
The bearers stopped rocking the chair and calmed the raging sea.
"He lay there, trying to remember Whiskers' fight with the wrestlers in the tavern."
"'Old Man in heaven, protect me!'"
After much hesitation he proceeded to give her a detailed account of his dream.
"Compared to the idea of the universe flickering, he would prefer a supernatural saboteur."
This naturally drew more curious gazes.
'What did you want to wrap your face up for?'
"I told him that I didn't have anything (food, utensils, etc.), so I couldn't go to the thermal springs."
"Since you need such low precision, we can just use some basic data from COBE."
At the time the hospital was rampant with hepatitis.
"She said that it was a serious film, unlike this one, which was pure buffoonery, no better than a circus sideshow."
"Trinket began to choke, thrashed out with his feet to extricate himself, and finally managed to wriggle on top of the boy and hold him down."
"'Well, of course, first and foremost we came to see you,' replied Grannie Liu mendaciously, 'but we were also hoping to pay our respects to Her Ladyship."
"'Were you just passing by, or have you come specially?'"
She pulled Wang Qiyao away so they could go look around other parts of the studio.
"The director was disappointed, but his disappointment was partly for Wang Qiyao's sake."
He thumped the object tucked into his belt.
Everyone was trying to pick out a strong one for plowing the fields.
"Wu Peizhen was the first to lose her patience; after all, she was the more brazen one."
You'll have to go from here round to the back gate in the other street and ask for her there.'
"I hope you won't mind my saying so, but even if the child was a real nephew you would still need to go a bit easy on the familiarities."
"According to them that was because I was not reeducated enough, but Chen Qingyang said it was because someone kept me in mind."
She raised the curtain to get a glimpse of the man who ate fistcakes.
"Yu Zhan'ao approached the highwayman, his thin lips curled resolutely, up at one end and down at the other."
"The thought flashed through Grandma's mind that there was nothing to be afraid of: if death couldn't frighten her, nothing could."
"Those hills were thick with grass, and under the grass lay red soil."
"Trinket recalled Whiskers' fight with the seven wrestlers at the inn, and shot out a quick left that caught the boy hard, fair and square, on the lower cheek."
"Then there was this little Buddha of mine, stiff and straight, and that was something I couldn't invent either."
But Trinket was not finished yet.
"The highwayman began pushing her into the sorghum field, his hand never leaving the object at his belt."
"With the students from Beijing on one side and the country boys on the other, everyone chose a weapon, either a wooden stick or a leather belt."
"And then suddenly, at exactly the same moment, they both burst out laughing."
He covered his eyes and began to cry.
"The error range is due to the Doppler effect from the motion of the Milky Way, which has already been filtered out."
"After that, Wang Qiyao stopped going."
Misty had beaten him to it!
"The elder Miss Wang was a very straightforward young lady, very easy to get on with, and not at all high and mighty."
I have a dozen more pairs upstairs.
"Before long, it was more like Wang Qiyao was doing her a favor by going with her."
"My mother also had bound feet, and just seeing them saddened me so much that I felt compelled to shout: 'Down with feudalism!"
"He came tumbling back, wrapped both arms round the boy's legs, and tugged at him with all his might."
She says please thank them very much for coming.
"'I won a dozen taels,' replied Trinket."
"Eat your lunch, and if you've no jobs to do, go and practise with the dice!'"
"When people said she was damaged goods and I was her lover, she came to see me every day."
'I didn't want anyone to recognize me taking the cake.'
"She was following local wedding customs, which dictated that a bride wear three layers of new clothes, top and bottom, no matter how hot the day."
"'Just stay here, Grannie,' they said."
'Tomorrow . . . tomorrow I'll take you on again . . . and I'll beat you for sure!'
But it was clear from the start the military deputy just wanted to make trouble for her.
"That was because when I was doing it, she didn't make a sound; she simply put her arms under her head and looked at me in a very thoughtful way."
"Occasionally, on her way home from school, something would unexpectedly stir up her memory of the screen test."
"Grandma stopped crying at the sound of the woodwind, as though commanded from on high."
"Several times, rushing to get out of one person's way, they bumped into someone else."
She was unsure if this was the opportunity she had been waiting for.
'Don't mind him; just stay where you are!
"He was so near she could have touched the pale, taut skin of his shaved head with her toe."
"Because of this, the team leader was even more unwilling to remember me."
"This way, visitors can put on the glasses at night and observe the cosmic microwave background on their own."
"She wondered how much farther it was to the Shan household; like a trussed lamb being led to slaughter, she grew calmer with each step."
"She felt humiliated; she could sense the perils of her future, knowing she'd spend the rest of her life drowning in a sea of bitterness."
You'd better bring three taels yourself!'
"Not only did he remember them, he addressed them jocularly as ""the girls from So-and-so middle school""—Wang Qiyao and Wu Peizhen turned a bright red."
"Once his eyes had grown used to the sight, Wang could see that the faint red background was indeed pulsing."
'I lent it yesterday to someone else.'
There was no wind that night either; the mountain was very still.
There is no need to tell me.
Everyone was trying to pick out a strong one for plowing the fields.
All I have to do is watch his moves and copy them.
"It was real, not dramatic—the kind of beauty that people noticed on the street and photo studios displayed in their front windows."
Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me?'
No longer did it seem like a wedding procession as they negotiated the dirt road; it was more like a funeral procession.
The delicate powder of petals floated above silvery new ears of waving sorghum.
"""We'll know soon enough,"" Sha said."
"If anyone spots you, you're as good as dead."
"I had him on the ground today, it's just that he was too strong for me: he managed to buck me off."
The team leader took a bunch of locals to stop them.
But I had only stayed in the hospital for a week and then run away.
"'I'll jump out and scare him off, then I can carry on eating to my heart's content.'"
"When he regained consciousness, he found that he was temporarily immobilized."
Wu Peizhen liked this scene much more than the first.
"By the time I came around, Luo Xiaosi had gathered a group of city students and was threatening to burn the cattle pen."
"Something was beginning to fall into place in Trinket's mind, with all these references to 'His Majesty'."
"She could hear the film running through the camera, a mechanical sound that seemed to override everything."
"And if you want to know what happened after she had left, you will have to read the next chapter."
"Xi-feng suddenly seemed to remember something, and called to him through the window, 'Rong, come back!'"
"The strong wind of the dry season blew endlessly, shaking the thatched hut."
Full-voiced strange and rare birds sang to her from the fields.
"Then you're to lend them money, the more the better."
"Then suddenly he drove his elbows hard into Trinket's ribs, and Trinket went reeling over on to the floor, screaming with pain, certain that he must have several broken bones."
"The flat line turned into a wave, the distance between one peak and the next inconstant."
'Give in my arse!' panted Trinket back.
They can sit here while they are waiting.'
"Finally, the team leader came over and said, Go phone Chen Qingyang."
"The locals all talked at once, saying that the city students had gone too far—we not only took their chickens and stole their dogs, but also beat their people."
"You see, we each have our own jobs here."
I said I wasn't really going to the thermal springs.
"I want to see the isotropic fluctuation in the overall cosmic microwave background, between one and five percent,"" he said, quoting from Shen's email."
"Trinket began to choke, thrashed out with his feet to extricate himself, and finally managed to wriggle on top of the boy and hold him down."
To get to the studio they had to take the trolley and make a transfer.
The crimson wedding veil was lifted to reveal a rigid expression; even the bit of natural charm that she normally had about her was frozen.
"By rights, of course, Callers and Visitors has nothing to do with me."
"Jia Rong came hurrying back, wreathed in smiles, and looked at Xi-feng with eyebrows arched inquiringly."
"Many local families had dreamed of marrying into the Shan family, despite rumours that Shan Bianlang had leprosy."
"When the sedan chair reached the plains, the bearers began to get a little sloppy, both to make up time and to torment their passenger."
'She said they don't really belong to the family but were adopted into the clan years ago when your grandfather and theirs were working in the same office.
So she made it sound like she would only be punished for what she had just done.
"From now on, if such great fluctuations occur, the data will be automatically saved to disk."""
"""I must get my hands on a pair before five."""
To simultaneously alter the data from three satellites and an observatory on Earth?
"I began to put on my pants, but again she said, Don't!"
That means I've become a little Palace Eunuch myself!
"He also said my behavior met the criteria for my classification as one of ""the bad elements,"" and I should be punished by the proletarian dictatorship."
A picture of what she imagined to be the bridegroom slowly took shape from the threads of sunlight filtering into the darkness of the sedan chair.
"When we first made love, many details puzzled me."
"Chen Qingyang said she couldn't believe it: I actually had the impudence to display my ugly male organ in front of her, without feeling the least embarrassed."
"From then on Bao-yu treated Aroma with even greater consideration than before, whilst Aroma for her part redoubled the devotion with which she served him."
"You're talking about a supernatural saboteur."""
"Shortly after leaving the village, the lazy musicians stopped playing, while the bearers quickened their pace."
"My man's is collecting the half-yearly rents in the spring and autumn; and when he's not doing that, he takes the young masters out when they go on visits."
Wu came to fetch him again the following morning.
"Actually, my existence was an indisputable fact."
"It was covered with bowls and dishes containing all kinds of meat and fish, only one or two of which appeared to have been touched."
"You're talking about a supernatural saboteur."""
They didn't say anything about someone getting caught when we were gambling . . .
"'Hey!' screamed Trinket, 'that's not fair!"
I just wanted to stay on the back slope of the mountain for a few days.
"To her, I was the precise image of someone seen from behind, hurrying down the mountain, a man in her memory."
It had the power to make what was dark and dismal glimmer with light.
Wang Qiyao felt a bit uncomfortable under her stare.
"'I wonder what that can be,' she thought to herself, 'and what it can be used for?'"
"""Can you ... be more specific?"""
"When she walked, swinging her arms freely, her body swayed like a willow in the wind."
He had driven a silk shop in Hangzhou into the ground and Wu Peizhen's mother had dreaded his visits because all he ever wanted from her was money or grain.
'It's hard times that keeps us away.
The rainwater washed Yu Zhan'ao's head so clean and shiny it looked to Grandma like a new moon.
She said it was nice of them to come and see us today and we should be careful to treat them considerately.
So the topic of conversation turned to Ye Wenjie.
She only has to feel well disposed and a hair off her arm would be thicker than a man's waist to poor folks like us!'
The old eunuch felt around in the small of his back and pressed lightly.
"If she didn't like the idea, she could have told me before."
This naturally drew more curious gazes.
"He pulled a piece of silver from his pocket, about three taels' worth: 'Tomorrow we fight for money!"
The director led them into the dressing room and had a makeup artist work on Wang Qiyao.
So she made it sound like she would only be punished for what she had just done.
The holdup of Grandma's sedan chair by a highwayman at Toad Hollow occupies an important place in the saga of my family.
"The sun hung in the western sky above the apartment buildings, glowing ripe and golden."
Wang could hear his rapid breathing.
"The team leader said, Who's Wang Er?"
"He pulled a piece of silver from his pocket, about three taels' worth: 'Tomorrow we fight for money!"
"It seemed necessary back then, though."
"'Bless you, my dear, for being such a help!' said Grannie Liu."
"If things get really bad, I can simply run the hell away."
The wavelength of the cosmic microwave background is seven centimeters.
"The low curtain of heaven stared darkly at the silvery faces of sorghum, over which streaks of blood-red lightning crackled, releasing ear-splitting explosions of thunder."
"He slept till evening, when a junior eunuch brought in their supper."
"You mustn't let yourself throw up, Fenglian."
"She was not the least bit worried about becoming actual damaged goods, which she much preferred to being damaged goods in name only."
She wondered: Could my big chance really come this easily?
'What are you so happy about?' snapped the old eunuch.
At night Chen Qingyang and I would make love in my small hut.
To get to the studio they had to take the trolley and make a transfer.
He didn't want to discuss the subject any further.
"'Into the sorghum field!' the highwayman said, his hand still resting on the red-bundled object at his belt."
He used to be very friendly with us at one time.'
"'I'll jump out and scare him off, then I can carry on eating to my heart's content.'"
"I don't expect you know, but things here are very different from what they were five years ago."
There was no doubt about it.
Old Hai was sitting at a table (the broken one had been replaced).
'Take this for the time being to make some winter clothes for the children with.
"And then again, of course, though we may look thriving enough from the outside, people don't realize that being a big establishment like ours carries its own difficulties."
Wang could hear his rapid breathing.
The trolley was half empty; the after-work rush hour was over and Shanghai's nightlife had yet to begin.
"I ought to have lent the money to one of the Wen brothers, that's right, I remember now, you told me.'"
She planned to sneak off alone and return before anyone noticed that she was gone.
Why don't you try your luck with her?
All he knew was that the Emperor wore a Dragon Robe.
"He moved his mouse and clicked ""Print."""
"Just before dawn, the roads were relatively empty."
"Suddenly she woke from her trance, her face blushing with embarrassment."
"By using cheap grain to make wine, the Shan family made a very good living, and marrying my grandma off to them was a real feather in Great-Granddad's cap."
"And if he was to be a man of his word, he would have to forget about escape—at least for the time being."
"To me, it didn't really matter whether I existed or not."
Wang ducked back into the car and left the planetarium.
There is no need to tell me.
"As Sha finished one beer after another, his tongue loosened even more."
"If you could take us to see her, that would be very nice; but if that's not possible, perhaps we could trouble you just to give her our regards.'"
"The rain beat a loud tattoo on the sedan chair and fell on Grandma's embroidered slippers; it fell on Yu Zhan'ao's head, then slanted in on Grandma's face."
"I hope you won't mind my saying so, but even if the child was a real nephew you would still need to go a bit easy on the familiarities."
Suddenly everything was swathed in darkness.
"Their eyes, too, were dazzled by the bright and glittering things that filled the room."
That should fix the little bugger!'
"This compassion predisposed Wang Qiyao to be generous, but naturally this generosity did not extend any further than Wu Peizhen."
"Yet at the time she just took off her white smock, sat beside me, and stared at my little Buddha, thinking he was the color of a burn scar."
"The initial onslaught was met by screams and shrill cries, which soon died out."
"My God, she thought, it's a man who eats fistcakes!"
"Those hills were thick with grass, and under the grass lay red soil."
She could see the polished purple scholar-tree poles and the bearers' broad shoulders beneath them.
"The film studio was a hubbub of activity, like a busy dockyard."
"Then Wang Qiyao snapped out of her daze, her shivering ceased, and her heart rate returned to normal."
There are no tax-collectors in my family and no mandarins among my friends.
"And there was Chen Qingyang, who said that I hurried down the mountain in my green fatigues."
"She even got neurotic and thought that the makeup man, impatient to get finished with her, was applying the makeup hurriedly and crudely."
Both of them felt a bit gloomy and Wu Peizhen fell silent.
"The director, on the other hand, became serious and cold, as if he did not even know them."
"Before long the director sent someone over to escort Wang Qiyao to the set, Wu Peizhen naturally following close behind."
"Wang Qiyao naturally did not take him too seriously, but she did kind of like being compared to Ruan Lingyu."
"I didn't expect Shan Men Er's mother to sneak up from behind, pick up a heavy stool, and slam my lower back, right on my old injury."
"He'd just been improvising and thrashing around, and somehow or other had managed to outwit his opponent."
"But having decided to let everything ride, she was actually quite calm and composed."
"The bearers lowered the sedan chair to the ground, took out their copper coins, and did the same."
"Just like that, he was seeing the cosmic microwave background."
"One of the musicians raised his trumpet and brought it down hard on the highwayman's skull, burying the curved edge so deeply he had to strain to free it."
She lives round at the back.
"She rose to her feet, and Grannie Liu, with heartfelt expressions of gratitude, picked up the money and followed Zhou Rui's wife out of the room."
"And so that is how the screen test ended, just another trifling incident in the life of the film studio."
"If no one came to look for me, I could grow some corn around the place and never leave."
'I wonder if Grannie has eaten yet today?'
All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets.
"Before long, it was more like Wang Qiyao was doing her a favor by going with her."
"As Wang got up to leave, he was held back by a snippet of hymnal music."
One of the four men bearing Grandma's sedan chair that day would eventually become my granddad – it was Commander Yu Zhan'ao.
"Ninety-two hours had already elapsed, and only 1,108 hours remained."
Someone asked the cousin who his guests were and he told him.
"The next thing she knew, a crimson bridal veil came down over her head."
"Xi-feng nodded, and Grannie Liu sat herself down on the edge of the kang."
Now my job is to attend to their ladyships and the young mistresses when they go out.
He even felt that the wrinkles in the flags flapping next to him and the ripples in the puddle on the side of the road might be sending him messages.
A warm wind rustled the emerald-green stalks of sorghum lining the narrow dirt path.
The first thing she said was: Don't worry.
His thoughts ran on: 'What a fool I was just now!
"Grandma was lightheaded and dizzy inside the stuffy sedan chair, her view blocked by a red curtain that gave off a pungent mildewy odour."
But the diffraction of centimeter-wave radiation overwhelmed all other shapes and details.
"He handed him a small suitcase and said, ""There are five pairs of 3K glasses in here, all fully charged."
"With growing excitement, Grandma stared fearlessly at the green waves raised by the black winds."
He returned home to vent some of his spleen on his long-suffering wife.
"My word is my wand!' cried Trinket, and Misty burst out laughing."
"Trinket took advantage of the fact that Misty was busy speaking and momentarily off his guard, to launch a counter-attack."
"But his eyes roamed, trying to capture other sights."
"Luo Xiaosi came back to the fourteenth team and found my stuff gone, so he went to ask the team leader whether he had seen me."
"As for the Beijing relief delegation sent to investigate the city students' situation, everyone in the local area knew about it except for me."
"I reached out my hand and touched her nipples, until her face flushed and her nipples turned hard."
"He says I've got to fight with him every day, until I can beat him."
He led Grannie Liu into a rear courtyard.
"The universe would flicker like a fluorescent tube that's about to burn out!"""
"Since they stuffed the rolled flatbreads into their mouths with both fists, they were called 'fistcakes'."
"As they looked at the terminal, the fluctuation was just getting started."
He had Wang Qiyao sit on a bed.
That night she even had a dream about the film studio.
Chen Qingyang didn't give me the information because she didn't care about it—she was not one of the city students.
She gave Ban-er a despairing push.
"It looked silly and shameless, and whenever she saw him, she just couldn't help getting angry."
"He'd just been improvising and thrashing around, and somehow or other had managed to outwit his opponent."
Wang's cries were interrupted by laughter.
During the previous few takes the light had been marked by an unbridled brilliance.
"From the size of his footwear, the new arrival seemed to be a boy like himself."
"Unable to overcome her curiosity, Chen Qingyang finally dropped everything and went up the mountain to look for me."
"Later, in order to make things up to her, he had a photographer friend of his do a photo shoot for her—but this photo shoot turned into something quite extraordinary."
"If you just need one percent precision, data from the antique COBE is sufficient."""
He also thought that since I took so much food with me I probably wouldn't come back.
"One glance told them that she was an outsider, but just as she was getting ready to ask directions they would immediately look away."
"Just like that, he was seeing the cosmic microwave background."
"In the end, he still couldn't get anything out of me."
He couldn't be sure since he had never heard me speak a single word.
"Since you need such low precision, we can just use some basic data from COBE."
"The boy stood there stunned for a few seconds, and a momentary look of anger came into his eyes."
Sha wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead and nodded.
"She rose from the seat, stepped grandly onto the pole, and alit in a tuft of cornflowers."
So the topic of conversation turned to Ye Wenjie.
"Just before dawn, the roads were relatively empty."
"Amid this sea of indifference, Wang Qiyao and Wu Peizhen were animated and alive."
"""Can you ... be more specific?"""
"'It's starting to rain,' he said, 'so let's get going.'"
"Having made love to Chen Qingyang, I was no longer a virgin."
Better go to the thermal springs.
"""Hahaha, another one bites the dust!"""
"""That's more than enough,"" Sha interrupted, waving his hands."
"Chen Qingyang's search for me could be summed up as follows: Two weeks after I went into the mountains, she went up the mountains to look for me."
"When I made love to Chen Qingyang, a lizard crawled out of a crack in the wall and crossed the ground in the middle of the room, moving intermittently."
"And the stage eunuchs always held those long horsehair fly-whisks, and kept waving them around in the air."
"Misty spun round and sat astride his chest, once more the victor, though this time a winded and exhausted one, panting for breath."
'You obviously don't know the first thing about wrestling!'
"And so that is how the screen test ended, just another trifling incident in the life of the film studio."
I also thought about the problem of whether I existed or not in my little thatched hut.
Suddenly everything was swathed in darkness.
"short-long-long-long-long, short-long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long-long, long-long-long-short-short, long-long-long-short-short-short, short-short-long-long-long, short-long-long-long-long, long-long-long-short-short-short, short-short-short-long-long, long-long-short-short-short."
He would have to go back to the old eunuch that evening.
I hope she won't be angry with me for pushing myself forward.'
"Chen Qingyang's search for me could be summed up as follows: Two weeks after I went into the mountains, she went up the mountains to look for me."
"Well, it would be much better if Professor Ye were here."
"Afterward, she said she had fallen deep into sin and karma would catch up with her sooner or later."
They had no choice but to stand off to one side and wait idly.
That night Chen Qingyang accompanied me to the hospital and waited until the x-ray of my lower back was developed.
"Come on, Auntie, be a sport!"
"After looking her up and down for a moment or two, they asked her her business."
"The more transparent something was, the more mysterious it seemed."
"The set lights came up and this time the shouts of ""OK"" sounded perfunctory."
"It was a Nanjing-style bed with ornate flower patterns carved into the woodwork, a mirror set into the headboard, and high bed curtains all around—all the signs of rustic elegance."
Trinket peeped out from behind the table-cloth.
"In the pale white light of dawn, the church's Romanesque vaults appeared as three giant fingers pointing out something in space for him."
Suddenly her face flushed and she gave a little laugh: 'It doesn't matter.
"I sat in my little hut, listening to the leaves rustling all over the mountain, finally reaching a state where object and subject were both forgotten."
He could not see any stars.
"He suddenly thought of something, and added: 'If I did get caught, I'd never dream of dragging you into it, Goong-goong!'"
"Several times, rushing to get out of one person's way, they bumped into someone else."
"Misty toppled over, and Trinket punched him in the small of the back."
The other members of the clan were unaware that any such relationship existed.
Then one day she told Wang Qiyao in a confessional tone that her cousin had invited them back to the film studio but she had already declined the offer.
"Grandma was confused, not knowing if this was true or not."
"If there had been no Wang Er to tell her the route, she wouldn't have been able to find such a tiny hut in the vast, wild mountains."
We're here to build up our country's borderland.
"Where she would come by a nephew like this one, I just do not know!'"
He couldn't be sure since he had never heard me speak a single word.
Trinket helped himself to a big handful of cakes and stuffed them inside his jacket.
"'Please, Aroma,' Bao-yu shamefacedly entreated as she helped him change, 'please don't tell anyone!'"
"The military deputy had a talk with me, asking me to write a confession."
"A few minutes later, a red waveform appeared in the browser window, moving in step with the other three."
Then one day the director telephoned Wang Qiyao at home to have her come down to the studio for a screen test.
"I would bet that it's going to stay a flat green line until the end of the world, though."
'Did you take in what I said just now?' growled Old Hai.
"The panting bearers were drenched with sweat as they entered Toad Hollow, over which the air hung heavily."
Then he too left the room.
"As a young maiden, she had embroidered a wedding trousseau and several exquisite pictures for the man who would someday become my granddad."
"When he heard this, Luo Xiaosi couldn't help crying."
The season was now at the turn between autumn and winter.
"After you've made such a long pilgrimage, we won't let you go home without seeing a real Buddha!"
"The next thing she knew, a crimson bridal veil came down over her head."
"""It was only recently revealed that she had spent more than twenty years at Red Coast Base."""
He wished he could remember the details more clearly.
'Better my arse!' muttered the eunuch.
Trinket leapt on him from behind and gripped him tightly round the throat with both his hands.
"Say what you like, a hair plucked from your arm is thicker than a man's waist to folks like us!'"
"The cold weather was beginning, but none of the preparations for winter had yet been made."
Old Zhou once entrusted a bit of business to my father.
"Just at that moment Zhou Rui's wife appeared, her face all wreathed in smiles, and advanced towards Grannie Liu beckoning."
"At that moment, her feeling for Wang Qiyao approached maternal love—a love that encompassed all."
Grandma ripped the curtain from the front of the carriage and stuffed it behind the seat.
"The bearers lowered the sedan chair to the ground, took out their copper coins, and did the same."
"Clearly bored with his long isolation and happy to have a visitor, he asked Wang what kind of data he wanted to see."
"He told them to wait a little while, and then he would take them to watch a special effects shoot that was going on at one of the other sets!"
"In no time she was talking about organizing press conferences for Wang Qiyao, who regretted telling her friend about the screen test."
"As they redid the scene, everything grew fuzzy."
A warm wind rustled the emerald-green stalks of sorghum lining the narrow dirt path.
"Just then my thatched hut began to shake in the wind, streams of sunlight leaked through the roof and spattered her body, like stars."
"Trinket noticed at once that he was wearing a completely new outfit, and couldn't help feeling jealous."
"After that, Wang Qiyao stopped going."
He crumpled up and fell to the ground in excruciating pain.
"'This Mrs Lian,' said Grannie Liu: 'she can't be more than eighteen or nineteen years old."
"You never know, she might do something for you for the sake of old times."
At this point Zhou Rui's wife returned with a message for Xi-feng.
"Films scripts were revised at random, and in the blink of an eye even the dead could come back to life."
My words still echoed in her ears.
"Three months later, a bridal sedan chair would come to carry her away."
There is no need to tell me.
"A powerful sense of déjà vu gripped her, but no matter how hard she tried, she could not remember where she had seen this scene before."
"He had given them the nicknames ""Zhen Zhen"" and ""Yao Yao,"" as if they were characters in his latest movie."
It was Misty's voice calling from the doorway.
Have you forgotten everything I ever told you?'
The other side picked up only after a long while.
"The two eggs she'd eaten for breakfast churned in her stomach, the flies buzzed around her ears; her throat tightened, as the taste of eggs surged up into her mouth."
"Then there was this little Buddha of mine, stiff and straight, and that was something I couldn't invent either."
"'Well then, don't sit around doing nothing."
"The military deputy had a talk with me, asking me to write a confession."
'I didn't think it would be hard.
'Now I can think of a chance you might try.
"Chen Qingyang said that when she decided to head up the mountain to search for me, she didn't have anything on under her white smock."
I sped up and waves of vibration passed through me as if from the earth's core.
"She came to understand the significance of the word ""Camera"": it announced a kind of climax."
"When the word ""Camera"" was called out, it too seemed little more than a formality—but this formality still carried with it an air of authority, of unwavering power."
Just imagine the look on their faces!
"Their faces were rigid, as if nothing in the world concerned them."
Suddenly everything was swathed in darkness.
Over there in the city the streets are paved with money just waiting for someone to go and pick it up.
"""It all comes down to money."
So they carried me to the ox cart and sent me to the hospital at the farm headquarters.
"'Could this be the Palace, the Forbidden City itself!' he thought silently to himself."
"After editing and postproduction, only the pure essence would remain."
"Occasionally, on her way home from school, something would unexpectedly stir up her memory of the screen test."
"Chen Qingyang said that the military deputy would definitely not go easy on me, perhaps I would be kept-in-mind half to death."
"Grannie Liu, acutely embarrassed in this male presence, did not know whether to sit or stand, and looked round her in vain for somewhere to hide herself."
All Trinket could think about was his appointment with Misty.
The two returned to the first set only to discover that everyone had gone.
I drew a conclusion from these experiences: never let other people pay attention to you!
"""This must be some joke from Professor Ye,"" Sha said."
"Her face, suddenly old and desiccated, was pearled with tears."
"The incident at the film studio ended with the word ""camera,"" and the result was what they call in the industry a ""freeze frame."""
I'd never dare show my face among the Brothers!'
I have been destroyed by a miserly father and a heartless mother!
"Trinket began to choke, thrashed out with his feet to extricate himself, and finally managed to wriggle on top of the boy and hold him down."
Grannie Liu could eventually stomach no more of his wife-baiting and intervened on her daughter's behalf.
"And so, that very evening, the matter was settled."
The wavelength of the cosmic microwave background is seven centimeters.
"Later, when I was in the hospital, nobody came to see me either."
"And from her student, Wang finally learned about her life."
The trouble was that Trinket could barely read.
Sorghum crumpled under the wild rain.
You have to knee him on the vital point in the small of his back.
'But you're a quick mover all the same!
"But Wang Qiyao's decision to befriend Wu Peizhen meant, in some way, that she was pushing a heavy load onto Wu Peizhen's shoulders."
"When she saw me come into her clinic, she gave me a faint smile and said, Are you completely recovered?"
"The incident at the film studio ended with the word ""camera,"" and the result was what they call in the industry a ""freeze frame."""
"The panting bearers were drenched with sweat as they entered Toad Hollow, over which the air hung heavily."
Her brother has been promoted; but I shouldn't be surprised if she at least didn't still remember us.
"So I asked her if she hadn't felt like doing it, why had she agreed?"
What would have been poor self-esteem was replaced by a kind of modesty—modesty ruled by a practical spirit.
He treated Wu Peizhen as if she were a child; he loved to tease her and play little jokes on her.
"She was not the least bit worried about becoming actual damaged goods, which she much preferred to being damaged goods in name only."
You'll never guess who that is:
They arrived back at the lab at one.
The urchin stared back at her impudently.
"Inside, under the window in the south wall, there was a kang covered with a dark-red carpet."
"The harsh, unmodulated light of the dressing room made everything appear commonplace."
"For our team leader, my nonexistence was very convenient, because then no one could prove any of the city students had been beaten senseless."
I also thought about the problem of whether I existed or not in my little thatched hut.
"Everywhere you looked, narrow stems of cornflowers were bosomed by clumps of rank weeds, their purple, blue, pink, and white flowers waving proudly."
"Their eyes, too, were dazzled by the bright and glittering things that filled the room."
Wang could tell from the one-sided conversation that he was trying to get in touch with the Ürümqi radio astronomy observatory.
He put the glasses on and looked around.
"However, the lowland on the back slope of the deserted mountain was crisscrossed with gullies and ditches; and fragrant grass grew lush in the sparse woods."
"As a result he eventually came off the loser again, with Misty sitting on his back, and no hope of throwing him off."
"""That is ... a fantastical legend."""
But the image of that crimson wedding veil and the dazzling studio lights were already imprinted in her mind and reappeared whenever she closed her eyes.
"You see, we each have our own jobs here."
'Listen: you're to win money from the Wen brothers.
"If you just need one percent precision, data from the antique COBE is sufficient."""
To live in the world of the film studio is to lead a dual life.
"But he had never done this sort of thing before, and it was hard to find the point at his very first attempt."
"""Nothing would please me more than to discover that it was a joke,"" Wang said."
"After several more minutes of futile struggle, he surrendered yet again."
"In the pale white light of dawn, the church's Romanesque vaults appeared as three giant fingers pointing out something in space for him."
"Trinket lunged after him, the boy leant a little to one side, put out a leg, and brought him tumbling to the floor."
Meanwhile he could hear noisy munching coming from the table above him.
"Trinket lunged after him, the boy leant a little to one side, put out a leg, and brought him tumbling to the floor."
He went into the dim interior of the planetarium.
"If he didn't exist, where did his name come from?"
"The bedroom set seemed to be further away, but the scene became even more alive."
"He remembered Old Hai's little demonstration, and felt for the vital point in the small of Misty's back."
Wang ducked back into the car and left the planetarium.
"Who knows, He might give us the opportunity we are looking for."
"As it happened, he was one of the workers breaking down the set."
The scene made Wang shudder despite the warmth of the spring evening.
'I have something to say to you.
That year Grandma was five feet four inches tall and weighed about 130 pounds.
"""Nowhere,"" Wu Peizhen casually responded, as she gave Wang Qiyao a knowing pinch on the arm."
Trinket sounded very pleased with himself.
Their name was Wang and they were natives of these parts.
"Yet, when she shared her anxieties with her parents, Great-Granddad hemmed and hawed, while Great-Grandma scolded the girlfriends, accusing them of sour grapes."
"Although on the outside she looks like a grownup, deep down she is still a child!"
She's now the wife of the younger of the two Sir Jias in the Rong mansion.
Someone came and straightened out her clothing and then quickly walked off set.
The holdup of Grandma's sedan chair by a highwayman at Toad Hollow occupies an important place in the saga of my family.
"If no one came to look for me, I could grow some corn around the place and never leave."
They didn't say anything about someone getting caught when we were gambling . . .
"No problem, since I'm working the night shift, anyway."
"She finally found her cousin's place, only to discover that he was not home."
"Summer was giving way to autumn, and the sunlight outside the sedan chair was brilliant."
'Now you are really being too hard on us!
"I said, since you don't even want to look at him, let's just forget the whole thing."
She opened her eyes in the pitch-dark bedroom and wondered: Just what kind of place is this film studio anyway?
"'Is he dead?' asked the musician, who was examining the bent mouth of his trumpet."
"The boots reached the door, and came on into the room."
"Standing there like an angry cobra, the thing was indeed homely."
"Wang took off the 3K glasses and sat down weakly on the ground, leaning against the wheel of his car."
"He pulled a piece of silver from his pocket, about three taels' worth: 'Tomorrow we fight for money!"
Wang opened the suitcase on the backseat of his car and took out a pair of 3K glasses.
Wang Qiyao did not sleep well the night before; her face appeared thinner than usual and she had dark rings around her eyes.
The other members of the clan were unaware that any such relationship existed.
She got used to it after a while.
He helped himself to a cake.
He helped himself to a cake.
"At three o'clock in the afternoon, the Shanghai boulevards were suffused with weariness, preparing to sign out and change shifts."
"Or to be strictly accurate, Misty didn't mention it, and since he didn't, Trinket was more than happy to pretend to have forgotten."
"Who knows, He might give us the opportunity we are looking for."
"If we can't shake any words loose, we can at least shake the piss out of her!'"
"Without money, the secrets of the universe are worth shit."
"They won't believe it if you tell them, but it's true."
"When Yu Zhan'ao had drawn to within three paces of him, a shameful sound burst from his mouth, and he turned and ran."
The left button switches it on.
"They were hurt, but neither could say where the pain was."
"'If you want to stop him bucking you, that's easy!' said Old Hai."
The former is fake but appears real; the latter is real but seems fake.
'I won't let him get away with it!
Why don't you try your luck with her?
"'You know what they say: ""Important people have short memories."""
"Wang Xi-feng had on a little cap of red sable, which she wore about the house for warmth, fastened on with a pearl-studded bandeau."
I'd never dare show my face among the Brothers!'
Wu Peizhen liked this scene much more than the first.
She said she didn't want to be considered small-minded.
After that I was angry and upset.
It was the Wen brothers' turn to be bankers.
'I'm going to repeat it for you once more.
"This was her means of protecting herself—or then again, was it part of a strategy of disarming an antagonist by pretending to set her free?"
"Inside, under the window in the south wall, there was a kang covered with a dark-red carpet."
"""Hahaha, another one bites the dust!"""
"The boy said nothing, but feinted with his left fist."
"No, these things wouldn't have bothered her at all."
"Sedan bearers and musicians are low-class rowdies capable of anything, no matter how depraved."
Wu Peizhen caught her cousin in a lie.
Better to die and be done with it.
We had better come back some other time.
"In no time she was talking about organizing press conferences for Wang Qiyao, who regretted telling her friend about the screen test."
The sounds of Grandma's weeping had awakened seeds of affection that had lain dormant deep in his heart.
I thought I would wait for the young mistress to come back and explain it all to her.
Beside them stood a silver spittoon.
"The set lights came on, transforming the darkness into a thick crimson hue."
Old Hai heaved a strangely unconcerned sigh.
"'This Mrs Lian,' said Grannie Liu: 'she can't be more than eighteen or nineteen years old."
"She was, in any case, a year or two older than Bao-yu and had recently begun to have some understanding of the facts of life."
Wang's cries were interrupted by laughter.
"In Luo Xiaosi's words, Wang Er and Chen Qingyang took off their pants and screwed."
"She even cried in public and declared that if I didn't recover, she would take care of me all her life."
Wang Miao drove along Jingmi Road until he was in Miyun County.
"'We were on our way first thing this morning,' Grannie Liu chimed in."
"The other boy's first reaction was one of alarm, at the sight of this strange apparition with its head swathed in bandages."
"When Yu Zhan'ao had drawn to within three paces of him, a shameful sound burst from his mouth, and he turned and ran."
Inside the camera was a different world.
At the time the hospital was rampant with hepatitis.
"The harsh, unmodulated light of the dressing room made everything appear commonplace."
There was a strange frisson attached to that scene; it was the most dramatic moment in Wang Qiyao's quiet life.
"Suddenly, a price had been exacted and loss was imminent."
"Of course the Wen brothers won't let you see His Majesty; when they take you, His Majesty won't even be in the Upper Library."
"Wang took off the 3K glasses and sat down weakly on the ground, leaning against the wheel of his car."
"Just then one of the bearers spoke up: 'You there, little bride in the chair, say something!"
Wang Qiyao was to play a bride in a traditional wedding ceremony.
"Gone, never to return, but the memory hangs on for all eternity."
"'I knew all about that,' said Grannie Liu."
The air whisked against her as he passed by.
"He came tumbling back, wrapped both arms round the boy's legs, and tugged at him with all his might."
"Basking in each other's company, they became the best of friends."
Wu Peizhen had never had her sights set on the studio.
"This ""someone"" might have been the military deputy on our farm."
"He packed up the 3K glasses, stared at Wang for a few seconds, and quickly left with the suitcase."
"Trinket lost his balance, tottered and fell, bringing Misty down with him."
He eventually succeeded in jumping up and landing a head-butt right in the boy's midriff.
"Yu Zhan'ao walked calmly up to the man, who began backing up."
"My little Buddha still stuck out, glittering in the moonlight as if wrapped in plastic."
"If he had emerged the victor, it would have been a very different story."
What way could there be of laying my hands on some money?
"He also arranged for people to trail Chen Qingyang and me, trying to catch us in the act of adultery."
"You're talking about a supernatural saboteur."""
Better go to the thermal springs.
That year Grandma was five feet four inches tall and weighed about 130 pounds.
It was Misty's voice calling from the doorway.
She dreamed of an elegantly dressed woman under the mercury-vapor lamps.
Later Chen Qingyang told me that Luo Xiaosi had looked for me everywhere.
She laughed hard for a while and said she simply couldn't bear the sight of that thing on my body.
From then on the film studio became a place for frequent visits.
"You know what they say: ""Even the Emperor has poor relations."""
"'I live, you die!' laughed Misty, striding into the room."
"If you're paralyzed, I'll take care of you for the rest of my life."
These were things I didn't want to hear.
"If the kind of fluctuation you anticipate—in excess of one percent—occurs, this line would turn red and become a waveform."
"The path was so narrow in places it was barely passable, causing the wormy, sappy leaves to brush noisily against the sedan chair."
"They had both been quite carried away by the fighting, and neither of them had mentioned the money, or the bet they had laid."
After their eyes adjusted they made out a portion of the warehouse-like room that had been arranged to look like one half of a bedroom.
She wanted to forget the whole affair—that it had ever happened.
'I lent it yesterday to someone else.'
"She rose to her feet, and Grannie Liu, with heartfelt expressions of gratitude, picked up the money and followed Zhou Rui's wife out of the room."
I don't know what sort of relations we are and what I should call her.'
A dark-red patterned curtain hung from brass hooks over the doorway.
"Wang took off the 3K glasses and sat down weakly on the ground, leaning against the wheel of his car."
"She finally found her cousin's place, only to discover that he was not home."
"'You know what the old saying is, ""He who helps others helps himself."""
Neither of them paid attention during their classes that afternoon.
"First, there were the paging stations during the eighties."
She ordered Patience to take the key of the upstairs room and get some reliable servants to carry it over.
"Then she said, Never mind, let's not fight about it."
"Several times, rushing to get out of one person's way, they bumped into someone else."
Or maybe it signals the end of the whole world.
I was waiting for your instructions.'
She wanted to forget the whole affair—that it had ever happened.
"With a good deal of girlish simpering Grannie Liu sat down again, perching herself obliquely on the extreme edge of the kang."
"When we first made love, many details puzzled me."
Then he too left the room.
No one could successfully track me.
"But Wang Qiyao's decision to befriend Wu Peizhen meant, in some way, that she was pushing a heavy load onto Wu Peizhen's shoulders."
Grannie Liu thanked him and trotted off with little Ban-er all the way round to the rear entrance.
"A yard in length, the cloth bindings were wound around all but the big toes until the bones cracked and the toes turned under."
All he knew was that the Emperor wore a Dragon Robe.
"In Luo Xiaosi's words, Wang Er and Chen Qingyang took off their pants and screwed."
You'll never guess who that is:
I did not leave that night—Chen Qingyang caught me and asked me to stay in the name of our great friendship.
The two returned to the first set only to discover that everyone had gone.
"First, there were the paging stations during the eighties."
He returned home to vent some of his spleen on his long-suffering wife.
The left button switches it on.
"The day before, Wu Peizhen had agreed to take Wang Qiyao to have a look around the studio."
It was very much the same sort of technique as the one used by the Manchu wrestlers in the inn the previous day.
"""Can you ... be more specific?"""
The new boy was clearly tucking in.
"'Have I been wrong all this time, about it being the number one whore-house in Peking?"
"But having decided to let everything ride, she was actually quite calm and composed."
"For those like Luo Xiaosi, it would have been a great advantage to find me—I could prove that the city students in the area were treated badly, often beaten senseless."
They learned quite a few inside secrets about filmmaking.
"When they were indoors, Zhou Rui's wife ordered her little hired help to pour out some tea."
"'My dear good woman,' said the latter when they were out of earshot, 'whatever came over you?"
She could not make out the woman's features; all she could see was her head of disheveled hair strewn out along the foot of the bed.
Sha Ruishan's job was to create a more detailed map of the cosmic microwave background using observational data.
"At the end were two tall radio telescopes with dishes fifty meters in diameter, built in 2006."
Misty seemed somewhat taken aback by this but then concurred.
"I shoved him right in the chest, pushing him down on his butt."
"'If we fight a hundred times, you'll. . . you'll always lose!"
Suddenly her face flushed and she gave a little laugh: 'It doesn't matter.
"And now, we can use it to see the universe flicker."""
Wu Peizhen caught her cousin in a lie.
I just can't keep my mind on anything!'
Back in Zhou Rui's quarters the two women sat talking for a while.
"And from her student, Wang finally learned about her life."
"They were both getting anxious, feeling that the whole trip was a mistake."
"The bearers ran like scared jackrabbits, but couldn't escape the prenoon deluge."
"The fifteenth team's water was bitter, and there wasn't much to eat either."
Trinket had soon managed to win over twenty taels off them.
"According to him, he wouldn't give up until he made Wang Er talk."
The sleepy-eyed planetarium staffer was waiting by the door for Wang.
Ban-er at once hid himself behind her back and neither threats nor blandishments would induce him to come out and make a bow to his 'Auntie'.
"A heavy bracelet of twisted silver slid down to her wrist, and as she looked at the coiled-snake design her thoughts grew chaotic and disoriented."
"The universe itself was transparent; as long as you were sufficiently sharp-eyed, you could see as far as you liked."
"""This must be some joke from Professor Ye,"" Sha said."
"When a hand pulled away her wedding veil, she was so startled that she shrank back with fright."
"Trinket seized his chance, leapt up, and pinned his opponent down by the throat."
"The disconsolate weeping in the sorghum field was dotted with words, like knots in a piece of wood:"
"""I can't possibly explain this to you, Dr. Sha."
The director became quite close with the girls and they eventually stopped blushing in his presence.
"I've got company now, and besides, I don't feel in the mood to tell you.'"
"On one or two occasions they actually saw some of those famous movie stars, who sat in front of the camera doing nothing, like a collection of idle props."
Zhou Rui's wife darted a meaningful look at Grannie Liu as she said this.
"'Oh Grannie, how can you say such a thing?' said Zhou Rui's wife demurely."
"As distillery owners, the Shans used cheap sorghum to produce a strong, high-quality white wine that was famous throughout the area."
Where are you going with all that stuff?
The trouble was that Trinket could barely read.
I was waiting for your instructions.'
'I can remember going to their house once with my daughter.
"He was the director, the cousin later told them."
Old Hai was sitting at a table (the broken one had been replaced).
She noticed the glow emitting from the electric lamp and the rippling shadows of the lotus-shaped lampshade projecting onto the three walls of the set.
"'It's starting to rain,' he said, 'so let's get going.'"
"When he regained consciousness, he found that he was temporarily immobilized."
"I think it was back in the sixties when two Americans accidentally discovered the radiation when they were testing a supersensitive satellite reception antenna—"""
"Misty meanwhile had spun round, gripped Trinket's left arm, and twisted it back."
"A light down adorned her upper lip, and her fair skin was damp."
"The Qingping thermal springs were mud pools located in a valley, surrounded by nothing but wild, grassy hills."
"Once this happened, Wang Qiyao's expression relaxed, her powdered face lit up, and she came to life."
"Wang Qiyao naturally did not take him too seriously, but she did kind of like being compared to Ruan Lingyu."
"If this really is the Forbidden City, then old Wu and the Wen brothers and little Misty must all of them be eunuchs."
"The low curtain of heaven stared darkly at the silvery faces of sorghum, over which streaks of blood-red lightning crackled, releasing ear-splitting explosions of thunder."
The men's bodies emitted the sour smell of sweat.
"When she opened her eyes once again and looked, she saw the awkward expression of someone who had no desire to be there."
"The cousin also moved briskly, as if he had something urgent to take care of."
"Trinket went for him again, but this time Misty shook his head."
"Where she would come by a nephew like this one, I just do not know!'"
Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me?'
Come over here and I'll show you.'
"She opened her mouth and spewed a stream of filth, soiling the curtain, towards which the five flies dashed as though shot from a gun."
The two of them set to again.
"He also said my behavior met the criteria for my classification as one of ""the bad elements,"" and I should be punished by the proletarian dictatorship."
'You're probably the one who's not got the guts!
The other side picked up only after a long while.
"He felt a strange, perverse, immense presence that could never be understood by human intellect."
Trinket let out a gasp of pain.
"The young men of his generation were as sturdy as Northeast Gaomi sorghum, which is more than can be said about us weaklings who succeeded them."
"It was abundantly clear to Xi-feng that the old lady was too embarrassed to go on, and she put her out of her misery with a gracious smile."
At the heart of each halo was a radiation source.
We must try and catch her then.
What happened later all started there.
The studio simply could not schedule things the way they would like—they had to work around the stars' schedules.
"He remembered Old Hai's little demonstration, and felt for the vital point in the small of Misty's back."
"In the days following their visit to the film studio, Wang Qiyao did not utter a single word about their trip, and this left Wu Peizhen quite depressed."
"'No one's asking you to rob,' said Grannie Liu."
It's only a question of saying a few words.
They learned quite a few inside secrets about filmmaking.
Keep rocking!' one of the bearers roared.
"Wang Qiyao nodded, but deep down she was completely lost and had no idea where to begin."
"The inside of her skull felt cold one minute, as though filled with shiny pebbles, and hot the next, as though filled with coarse peppers."
"In those days, I was full of respect for the task, enthusiastic about every kiss and caress."
"Once this happened, Wang Qiyao's expression relaxed, her powdered face lit up, and she came to life."
The people who built huts on the hills and lived there year-round were usually patients with a variety of diseases.
"So to make peace, she softened her tone and said, ""Anyway, he is breathtakingly ugly—don't you agree?"""
"The crimson veil fluttered a bit, for a moment softening the anxieties of that afternoon."
"The highwayman began pushing her into the sorghum field, his hand never leaving the object at his belt."
He took the brush out of his mouth and talked to me with a mouth full of froth.
"Since I couldn't imagine these things, they must be evidence of my existence."
"Could it be that every time there was someone like me, who no one thought of, who bore the ultimate responsibility?"
"The rain beat a loud tattoo on the sedan chair and fell on Grandma's embroidered slippers; it fell on Yu Zhan'ao's head, then slanted in on Grandma's face."
"The set locations may have been dilapidated and in disrepair, but the images captured by the camera were always perfectly beautiful."
This was one occasion when even Wu Peizhen saw through Wang Qiyao.
Later Chen Qingyang told me that Luo Xiaosi had looked for me everywhere.
Beijingers say: Better a thief should steal from you than keep you in mind.
Wasn't that sufficient reason to be pleased?
"The boy made a grab for his back, but this time Trinket dodged in time and the boy seized a handful of air."
He took the brush out of his mouth and talked to me with a mouth full of froth.
"You know, Her Ladyship's eldest brother's daughter, that we used to call ""Feng-ge"" when she was a child.'"
"They had both been quite carried away by the fighting, and neither of them had mentioned the money, or the bet they had laid."
People were so afraid of this kind of damaged-goods behavior in broad daylight that they didn't even dare talk about it.
I told him that I might not be able to return them.
"That was why when Luo Xiaosi asked him where Wang Er had gone, he said, Wang Er?"
"They sat on opposite sides of the classroom, but, though their eyes never met, they could always feel one another's' presence."
"In case nothing came of the screen test, it would be her own little secret and she could pretend that nothing had ever happened."
"He packed up the 3K glasses, stared at Wang for a few seconds, and quickly left with the suitcase."
She came to see the film studio as a gift that she could offer to Wang Qiyao.
"The film studio was a hubbub of activity, like a busy dockyard."
Then he remembered that he had to switch them on.
"She stood like this in front of the crowd, submitting herself to all the shame and insults."
Then he remembered that he had to switch them on.
Wang Qiyao felt a bit uncomfortable under her stare.
"It's a Sutra, called the Sutra in Forty-Two Sections."
"As Trinket got up, he suddenly shot out one of his feet."
"The universe would flicker like a fluorescent tube that's about to burn out!"""
Twenty years ago the Nanking Wangs used to be very good to you folk.
"When he was properly dressed, they went to rejoin Grandmother Jia and the rest."
"Wang opened the car door and said, ""The flickering will stop at five in the morning."
"That done, she set off on her journey, and in due course made her way to Two Dukes Street."
"The inside of the sedan chair was badly worn and terribly dirty, like a coffin; it had already embraced countless other brides, now long dead."
He said he could lend me some things.
When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about 'difficulties' she concluded that there was no hope.
The aroma of sorghum burrowed into her heart.
She appreciated Wang Qiyao's magnanimity and tried even harder to please her as though repaying her kindness.
He had Wang Qiyao sit on a bed.
"Then, when Patience shortly afterwards addressed Zhou Rui's wife as 'Mrs Zhou', she knew that this was no mistress but a very high-class maid."
"Since it was drizzling, she had put on a pair of embroidered slippers soaked a dozen times in tong oil, which made a squishing sound when she walked."
"'Hey!' screamed Trinket, 'that's not fair!"
"Then calling her aside for a moment she asked, 'What did Her Ladyship say when you went to report about them just now?'"
'The wrestlers were no match for Whiskers; but Whiskers was no match for Old Turtle-head—why don't I get him to teach me a few moves?'
Grannie Liu invoked the Lord Buddha in pious disavowal of so shocking a view.
"Something was beginning to fall into place in Trinket's mind, with all these references to 'His Majesty'."
"They wouldn't miss a little thing like that, or expect me to pay for it!'"
"""This must be some joke from Professor Ye,"" Sha said."
I said I wasn't really going to the thermal springs.
"Wang Qiyao had learned that the most critical moment in making a film came the second that the director calls, ""Camera."""
The right dial is for adjusting brightness.
"Captain Shi Qiang stood there, blowing out a mouthful of white smoke."
"In those days, I was full of respect for the task, enthusiastic about every kiss and caress."
"He felt a strange, perverse, immense presence that could never be understood by human intellect."
Their hearts were filled with anticipation as if they were about to begin a brand-new day.
"She even cried in public and declared that if I didn't recover, she would take care of me all her life."
"She watched them do take after take without getting bored, the whole time exclaiming how much fun it was."
"'Well, after today's game, I met this . . . little eunuch, who stood in my way and asked me to give him some of my winnings."
"She could not believe it, neither did she dare not to believe it."
"Her friendship changed into a kind of pious waiting; she did not even look for any new girlfriends, afraid that they might take Wang Qiyao's place."
"A few more goes and I'd have had you, though—'"
I was waiting for your instructions.'
"They sat on opposite sides of the classroom, but, though their eyes never met, they could always feel one another's' presence."
"'Why, he's just another scavenger like me!' thought Trinket to himself."
"But Wang became anxious, and his mind kept returning to that green line on the terminal in Sha's office."
The boy groaned and staggered back a few steps.
It would be strange indeed if we didn't have a few!'
She stared at Yu Zhan'ao with a feverish look in her eyes.
Suddenly a thought occurred to him.
"Faced with so exuberant an abundance of material, what principle should your chronicler adopt to guide him in his selection of incidents to record?"
"If you don't mind it being so little, you are very welcome to take it.'"
Trinket staggered to his feet and took a few tottering steps across the room.
I think you'd better come back to feed the pigs.
"She wondered how much farther it was to the Shan household; like a trussed lamb being led to slaughter, she grew calmer with each step."
Thus an equilibrium of give-and-take was maintained between the two girls and they grew closer by the day.
"When she had a husband before, he did this to her every day."
"By the time Wu Peizhen got home, her family was already at the dinner table and she had to fib about where she had been."
"At their girls' school, where rumors usually flew rampant, not a soul knew about Wang Qiyao's screen test; they had succeeded in keeping it completely under wraps."
"Because of this, the team leader was even more unwilling to remember me."
"She admitted that she'd been wrong to slap me, and that she hadn't treated me well."
"As a young maiden, she had embroidered a wedding trousseau and several exquisite pictures for the man who would someday become my granddad."
"She started to avoid Wu Peizhen, as if the latter had stolen some secret from her."
"By the time she finally showed up, I had learned not to expect her."
"The bearers ran like scared jackrabbits, but couldn't escape the prenoon deluge."
"Grandma was confused, not knowing if this was true or not."
"Her reason for going rested entirely in making Wang Qiyao happy, so naturally she had hoped it would be a wonderful trip."
I'm going to fight him tomorrow!
That's five orders of magnitude longer than the wavelength of visible light.
Sooner or later she'll have to say something.'
"Now Master Rong, he is her real nephew."
Wu Peizhen liked this scene much more than the first.
"The whole way there Wu Peizhen couldn't stop jabbering, attracting curious glances from people on the street."
"Meanwhile, the vice team leader told someone to take me to the hospital on an ox cart."
"If this really is the Forbidden City, then old Wu and the Wen brothers and little Misty must all of them be eunuchs."
"'You know what they say: ""A prince's door is like the deep sea."""
"As she returned the gaze of the beauty in the mirror, the image she saw no longer seemed quite as distant and unrecognizable."
He covered his eyes and began to cry.
"But as my old face is tough enough to stand a slap or two, it's up to me to go."
"All the time she kept the question to herself, waiting for the day when he felt ashamed of himself and would explain why he did this to her."
"Not daring to go straight up, she first dusted down her clothes and rehearsed Ban-er's little repertoire of phrases before sidling up to one of the side entrances."
"Whether it was the classical missionary position, or man-from-behind position, man-from-side position, or woman-on-top position, I performed them in sober earnest."
I felt very strange after I heard her words.
Someone asked the cousin who his guests were and he told him.
"I told him that he could take his chances and give me trouble, but I was no pushover."
"Of course the Wen brothers won't let you see His Majesty; when they take you, His Majesty won't even be in the Upper Library."
He plugged in a network cable and picked up the phone.
He had pressed on exactly the spot Old Hai had been trying to teach him the previous evening.
"'Oh no, why should they be?'"
"As for the Beijing relief delegation sent to investigate the city students' situation, everyone in the local area knew about it except for me."
The bearers moved slowly behind the sedan chair.
Two teardrops as transparently pink as immature grains of sorghum wetted Grandma's eyelashes and slipped down her cheeks to the corners of her mouth.
Come over here and I'll show you.'
Frogs and toads croaked in loud welcome to the oncoming summer rainstorm.
Trinket didn't follow this at all.
From then on the film studio became a place for frequent visits.
She could see the polished purple scholar-tree poles and the bearers' broad shoulders beneath them.
The other side picked up only after a long while.
"In addition to a wok, bowls, a basin, and ladle, there was enough food for two of us to eat for an entire month."
"The woman's feet faced the headboard and her head lay propped against the foot of the bed, her slippers scattered on opposite sides of the room."
"My penis was like a skinned rabbit, red, shiny, and a foot long, frankly erect."
'Did you take in what I said just now?' growled Old Hai.
"The boy quickly grabbed his right leg and tugged at it, sending Trinket crashing down on his back."
He popped another slice of layer cake nonchalantly into his mouth.
Two teardrops as transparently pink as immature grains of sorghum wetted Grandma's eyelashes and slipped down her cheeks to the corners of her mouth.
Sha took out a notebook computer and rushed to turn it on.
They raised clouds of dust as they tramped along.
Zhou Rui's wife hurriedly rose to her feet and urged Grannie Liu to do likewise.
"Then people began to gather, forming a tight ring around us and urging us to fight."
The former is fake but appears real; the latter is real but seems fake.
"The director was disappointed, but his disappointment was partly for Wang Qiyao's sake."
I really wanted to prove that I didn't exist then.
Even the trolley seemed to be afflicted with an air of apathy as it rattled along the tracks.
"Xi-feng, however, sipped very intently from her teacup and mused for a while, saying nothing."
"She was wearing a cotton print jacket over green satin trousers, with scarlet bands of silk tied around her ankles."
"Yu Zhan'ao, bringing up the rear, spun around and glared."
He wasn't even sure whether I was a mute or not.
"If things get really bad, I can simply run the hell away."
"But having decided to let everything ride, she was actually quite calm and composed."
"Just what was so wonderful about the film studio, however, Wu Peizhen had not the slightest clue—she had to wait for Wang Qiyao's reaction to find out."
"If any good does come of the visit, we shall all of us benefit.'"
"When she walked, swinging her arms freely, her body swayed like a willow in the wind."
He promised to put Wang Qiyao in a scene in one of his movies as soon as the opportunity arose.
"""Can you print out the waveform?"" Wang asked."
"But she pinched my leg and said: Hurry, you idiot!"
"Right now, our only choice is to find technical means to shield against interference."
'I didn't think it would be hard.
"It was a Nanjing-style bed with ornate flower patterns carved into the woodwork, a mirror set into the headboard, and high bed curtains all around—all the signs of rustic elegance."
"The boy leapt astride him, pinned his head to the floor, and cried: 'Well!"
"He seemed to have turned into nothing but a simple timer, a bell that tolled for he knew not whom."
I kept silent as I heard the words.
"Equipment for receiving satellite data was squeezed into the main computer room, and three terminals displayed the information sent by the three satellites."
He said that's the way it goes around here.
"The wind had risen – a northeaster – and clouds were gathering in the sky, blotting out the sun and throwing the carriage into darkness."
"Maybe it would be better if the observatories were built in places farther away from cities?"""
But the diffraction of centimeter-wave radiation overwhelmed all other shapes and details.
"Their faces were rigid, as if nothing in the world concerned them."
"I began to put on my pants, but again she said, Don't!"
"However, this got me into a lot more trouble."
"By rights, of course, Callers and Visitors has nothing to do with me."
"It seemed necessary back then, though."
"Trinket waited on Old Hai as he ate a bowl of rice, and then helped him to bed."
"And she said if they appear to want anything, she would leave it to you to decide what we should do for them.'"
"He didn't dare to take a bite out of it, but softened it with his saliva, and then swallowed it silently down."
'There was no time to think about eating.'
The first truculent raindrops made the plants shudder.
Sha was excited to see Wang.
Deep down her heart was in knots.
They say throwing up in the bridal chair means a lifetime of bad luck. . . .
He put the glasses on and looked around.
"Wang Xi-feng had on a little cap of red sable, which she wore about the house for warmth, fastened on with a pearl-studded bandeau."
"With a flurry of shouts, the bearers and musicians fell upon the highwayman, fists and feet flying."
There are several Mrs Zhous here.
Then he too left the room.
"It's so many years since I saw you last, I'd forgotten all about you!"
"They won't believe it if you tell them, but it's true."
Wu Peizhen was a bit shy and waited outside.
"From now on, if such great fluctuations occur, the data will be automatically saved to disk."""
"How can we get more attention than China Mobile, China Unicom, China Netcom?"
Most of the rumors you hear came out of that book.
He had Wang Qiyao sit on a bed.
"A couple of days later, Luo Xiaosi brought several people to the hospital to see me."
"I sat in my little hut, listening to the leaves rustling all over the mountain, finally reaching a state where object and subject were both forgotten."
All the mystery and grandeur of the film studio hung suspended in the light shimmering outside her veil.
Trinket felt his whole body go limp.
"As they ascended the steps to the main reception room, a little maid lifted up the red carpet which served as a portiere for them to enter."
"Faced with so exuberant an abundance of material, what principle should your chronicler adopt to guide him in his selection of incidents to record?"
"A grandfather had held some very small official post in the capital and had there become acquainted with Wang Xi-feng's grandfather, the father of Lady Wang."
"To her, I was the precise image of someone seen from behind, hurrying down the mountain, a man in her memory."
Old Hai reached out his hand and pressed lightly on either side of Trinket's neck.
Painful needle pricks jabbed her heart.
"The bearers streaked down the road, yet the sedan chair was as steady as a skiff skimming across whitecaps."
From the glittering reception room they passed to a room on the east side of it in which Jia Lian's baby daughter slept.
"""It's a sort of science toy we made for the Capital Planetarium."
"After looking her up and down for a moment or two, they asked her her business."
His mind was empty of thoughts: Only the countdown pulsed against the dim red background of cosmic radiation.
There are several Mrs Zhous here.
"She crossed a sunlit meadow, entered a dry gully, and walked for a long time."
When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about 'difficulties' she concluded that there was no hope.
"'It's starting to rain,' he said, 'so let's get going.'"
"Bao-yu had long been attracted by Aroma's somewhat coquettish charms and tugged at her purposefully, anxious to share with her the lesson he had learned from Disenchantment."
She'll be coming out now!' and Patience and Zhou Rui's wife hurriedly rose to their feet.
"When the sedan chair reached the plains, the bearers began to get a little sloppy, both to make up time and to torment their passenger."
"I did want to study her anatomy, but that was with her permission, too."
He sat in front of St. Joseph's Church at Wangfujing.
Beijingers say: Better a thief should steal from you than keep you in mind.
The military deputy came to our team to do some grassroots investigation and then stayed.
"The woman's feet faced the headboard and her head lay propped against the foot of the bed, her slippers scattered on opposite sides of the room."
Who stole your chickens and dogs?
"She said she would come back to visit me in a couple of days, but she never did."
The team leader said he didn't want to give me a hard time; it was Shan Men Er's mother who was giving him a hard time.
'Now you are really being too hard on us!
"She could hear the film running through the camera, a mechanical sound that seemed to override everything."
'Sing us a song while we bear you along!'
"Heaven knows, you have enough stuff of your own over there; yet you have only to set eyes on anything of ours, and you want it for yourselves.'"
Wu Peizhen's eyes widened in disbelief.
"If this phenomenon should lead to some research result, I won't forget you."""
"Finally, the team leader came over and said, Go phone Chen Qingyang."
"I could build a thatched hut in some deserted spot, an empty mountain with no human trace—gurgling water with fallen petals."
Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me?'
"He was tired, so he sat down on a bench."
It was a bad day for the bank altogether.
"Dressed like this, she crossed a stretch of hills behind the fifteenth team."
The city turned into many hazy glowing halos.
"'You know what they say: ""Important people have short memories."""
"Shan Tingxiu, the groom's father, was walking around Great-Granddad's village, dung basket in hand, when he spotted Grandma among the other local flowers."
"Since it was drizzling, she had put on a pair of embroidered slippers soaked a dozen times in tong oil, which made a squishing sound when she walked."
"The sacrifices these strong young men made to carry their cargo into bridal chambers must have embittered them, which was why it seemed so natural to torment the brides."
"Some time later on, when you have nothing better to do, look in on us for a day or two for kinship's sake."
But Xi-feng laughed quite unconcernedly and told Patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string of cash to go with it.
"Trinket went for him again, but this time Misty shook his head."
All Trinket could think about was his appointment with Misty.
"He struck the figure first on the chest with one fist, then reached forward with both hands and grappled it by the waist, forcing it to the ground."
"He sailed through the air over the cornflowers, thrashing his arms and legs like an innocent babe, until he landed in the sorghum field."
Chen Qingyang then told him that she knew nothing about me.
"And if he was to be a man of his word, he would have to forget about escape—at least for the time being."
"He didn't explain to Wang what he was doing, his eyes locked onto the browser window on the notebook."
"If she has anyone with her, you had better leave it; but if she is free, tell her about their visit and see what she says.'"
"'Oh no, why should they be?'"
You should never let other people keep you in mind.
No one could successfully track me.
"All of them gazed up at the sky at the same angle, as though waiting expectantly for something."
"In the foggy dawn, I left her and went down the mountain to herd buffalo."
It never crossed my mind that I didn't look back as I walked.
"'If you won't lend it, my father will say that I didn't ask properly and I shall get a beating."
You should never let other people keep you in mind.
"Sedan bearers and musicians are low-class rowdies capable of anything, no matter how depraved."
"'Now where we live may be out in the country, but it's still ""in the Emperor's shadow"", as they say."
She left after making sure everything was fine.
"I gave her directions and even made a map for her, and then went into the mountains alone."
"As I passed the village well, I saw the military deputy at the well stand brushing his teeth."
"The incident at the film studio ended with the word ""camera,"" and the result was what they call in the industry a ""freeze frame."""
I could just stand in front of people and do a self-criticism.
"However, since none of them was sure about whether or not my back was broken, they were all afraid to move me."
"At last she spoke: 'Why not ask them in, then?'"
"As he went, he found himself thinking of Whiskers' heroic stand at Victory Hill: now there was a man!"
"Xi-feng, however, sipped very intently from her teacup and mused for a while, saying nothing."
We can let you have it back again as soon as he has gone.'
'Hold it right there!' the highwayman commanded feebly.
"How can we get more attention than China Mobile, China Unicom, China Netcom?"
"When the woman turned to her and smiled, Wu Peizhen saw that she was none other than Wang Qiyao; she was so excited that she woke up."
"He packed up the 3K glasses, stared at Wang for a few seconds, and quickly left with the suitcase."
It was a day of freedom for them.
"Now, about the book— I hope you haven't forgotten.'"
"'Just stay here, Grannie,' they said."
"What I've seen is enough, and I don't need any more confirmation."
There was something about the clinch they were in that struck them both as terribly funny.
Wu Peizhen's eyes widened in disbelief.
"At the time he was a beefy twenty-year-old, a pallbearer and sedan bearer at the peak of his trade."
"Luo Xiaosi said, Just a few days ago you called a meeting to denounce him, and the vixen hit him with a stool and almost killed him."
"'Go and have a look, then."
"Starting at the turn of the century, the Miyun Radio Astronomy Observatory had opened itself to visitors."
"""Ever since construction was completed, interference has been unceasing in the observational bands."
"He had given them the nicknames ""Zhen Zhen"" and ""Yao Yao,"" as if they were characters in his latest movie."
"She said they haven't been round much of late years, but in the old days when they used to visit us we never sent them back empty-handed."
His mind was empty of thoughts: Only the countdown pulsed against the dim red background of cosmic radiation.
"The food was cold, but he was hungry, and to him it was indescribably delicious."
'Climb down and come with me!' he ordered her.
"Say what you like, a hair plucked from your arm is thicker than a man's waist to folks like us!'"
Soon a flat green line appeared on the screen.
"Of course, it was not easy to catch me because I walked so fast."
She said she didn't want to be considered small-minded.
"The boy, it transpired, was extremely ticklish, and he couldn't help giggling, and loosened his grasp."
"Green flames seemed to shoot from his eyes, and crystalline beads of sweat scurried down his terrified face."
"Because if we don't, the money isn't going to come walking in the door of its own accord.'"
"But she said my great friendship was phony, and the reason I had tricked her into coming was to study her anatomy."
Then they went to an all-night bar for tourists and sat for two hours.
"Everywhere you looked, narrow stems of cornflowers were bosomed by clumps of rank weeds, their purple, blue, pink, and white flowers waving proudly."
"Yu Zhan'ao reached down, took the thing from the man's belt, and shook off the red cloth covering, to reveal the gnarled knot of a tree."
"As Sha finished one beer after another, his tongue loosened even more."
'If only I'd taken old Whiskers up on his offer!
Then they went to an all-night bar for tourists and sat for two hours.
"This compassion predisposed Wang Qiyao to be generous, but naturally this generosity did not extend any further than Wu Peizhen."
He wished he could remember the details more clearly.
"In any case, slapping me was unfair."
They say throwing up in the bridal chair means a lifetime of bad luck. . . .
"Eat your lunch, and if you've no jobs to do, go and practise with the dice!'"
"It was covered with bowls and dishes containing all kinds of meat and fish, only one or two of which appeared to have been touched."
"Later, in order to make things up to her, he had a photographer friend of his do a photo shoot for her—but this photo shoot turned into something quite extraordinary."
'They've finished serving lunch at Her Old Ladyship's.
It had the power to make what was dark and dismal glimmer with light.
"It wasn't Sunday, so it was likely a choir rehearsal."
"I suppose you're only a child though, you've never done it before."
He led Grannie Liu into a rear courtyard.
"Afterwards he went to lie down on the smaller bed, thinking to himself: 'Tomorrow, whatever else happens, I must win my fight with Misty!'"
"In order to earn some extra income, Sha often played the role of tour guide or gave lectures."
Trinket engaged in a quick moment's reflection: 'Misty has obviously had lessons—that's why he keeps getting the better of me.
What if Grandfather did make a little bit of a name for himself and we do hold some miserable little appointment?
Grannie Liu waddled up to them and offered a respectful salutation.
"Suddenly she woke from her trance, her face blushing with embarrassment."
"'Here is the twenty taels of silver,' said Xi-feng."
"The impression the film studio left on Wang Qiyao, on the other hand, was much more complicated."
"Eager to marry, she heard innuendos from her girlfriends that the Shan boy was afflicted with leprosy, and her dreams began to evaporate."
The sounds of Grandma's weeping had awakened seeds of affection that had lain dormant deep in his heart.
"I shoved him right in the chest, pushing him down on his butt."
"""What happens at the end of the countdown?"" Wang asked."
"But when the man asked where they went to school, the cousin was stumped and Wu Peizhen had to answer for herself."
I've always believed that marriages are made in heaven and that people fated to be together are connected by an invisible thread.
"In the distance, the red star atop the Beijing Exhibition Center's Russian-style spire reflected the light from the cars passing below, also twinkling randomly...."
"I shouldn't come into existence simply because a vixen hit me, nor should I stop existing because she hit me."
"'I live, you die!' laughed Misty, striding into the room."
Soon a flat green line appeared on the screen.
"She was, in any case, a year or two older than Bao-yu and had recently begun to have some understanding of the facts of life."
"I said if she thought I was a faker, why did she believe me?"
"'This little fellow Misty,' he began again, out loud, 'he wasn't such a good fighter really."
"It's a Sutra, called the Sutra in Forty-Two Sections."
It seemed many people didn't believe Wang Er so much as existed.
"In the end, the woman in bed stopped moving and stayed still in the same position for quite some time before the lights once again dimmed."
What happened later all started there.
The new scavenger had started hitting something.
"I didn't expect Shan Men Er's mother to sneak up from behind, pick up a heavy stool, and slam my lower back, right on my old injury."
All Trinket could think about was his appointment with Misty.
"Wait till you meet her, and you'll see what I mean."
Time spent in a film studio is never humdrum; the experience always hints at life's greater meaning.
"He felt a strange, perverse, immense presence that could never be understood by human intellect."
"'You are too late,' said Xi-feng."
"And once she goes off for her afternoon nap, we've really lost her!'"
"As she returned the gaze of the beauty in the mirror, the image she saw no longer seemed quite as distant and unrecognizable."
"To this day, whenever he thinks of me, he still can't figure out if I am mute or not."
"Yu Zhan'ao looked wordlessly first at the dead, then at the living."
It was the second time that I made love to Chen Qingyang.
I can tell people who I've seen.
"As he drew near the entrance, he heard the old fellow coughing."
Grannie Liu could eventually stomach no more of his wife-baiting and intervened on her daughter's behalf.
"She wondered how much farther it was to the Shan household; like a trussed lamb being led to slaughter, she grew calmer with each step."
"As he stared at the sequence of numbers, he said, ""Maybe the three satellites and the observatory are all malfunctioning."""
Grannie Liu waddled up to them and offered a respectful salutation.
I'd suggest you not pursue it after this.
"The crimson veil fluttered a bit, for a moment softening the anxieties of that afternoon."
A wall of pity grew between them.
"But the more certain something was, the more doubtful it became."
"And anyway, he had never understood a word of what they were singing."
Wasn't that sufficient reason to be pleased?
Trinket walked a few steps closer.
Patience at once made up her mind what to do.
No one will connect it to my nanotech research.
"I told him that he could take his chances and give me trouble, but I was no pushover."
One of the researchers who developed the deciphering system for the Red Coast Project emigrated to Europe and wrote a book last year.
"This way, visitors can put on the glasses at night and observe the cosmic microwave background on their own."
"'Now,' went on Old Hai, 'if you go stealing books from the Upper Library, you've got to be very smart, very careful."
"short-long-long-long-long, short-long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long-long, long-long-long-short-short, long-long-long-short-short-short, short-short-long-long-long, short-long-long-long-long, long-long-long-short-short-short, short-short-short-long-long, long-short-short-short-short—that's 1108:21:36."
"When Yu Zhan'ao had drawn to within three paces of him, a shameful sound burst from his mouth, and he turned and ran."
"She said they haven't been round much of late years, but in the old days when they used to visit us we never sent them back empty-handed."
The director became quite close with the girls and they eventually stopped blushing in his presence.
The director led them into the dressing room and had a makeup artist work on Wang Qiyao.
"Just before dawn, the roads were relatively empty."
"She came to understand the significance of the word ""Camera"": it announced a kind of climax."
"However, the lowland on the back slope of the deserted mountain was crisscrossed with gullies and ditches; and fragrant grass grew lush in the sparse woods."
'I'll shoot if you take another step!'
"Occasionally, on her way home from school, something would unexpectedly stir up her memory of the screen test."
Misty went flying over his head and landed widi a crash on the ground.
He had driven a silk shop in Hangzhou into the ground and Wu Peizhen's mother had dreaded his visits because all he ever wanted from her was money or grain.
"A change came over the highwayman's face, and he gripped the object at his belt tightly."
"Xi-feng appeared not to have noticed her, for she neither reached out for the cup nor raised her head, but continued picking ab-sorbedly at her hand-warmer."
He treated Wu Peizhen as if she were a child; he loved to tease her and play little jokes on her.
"If any good does come of the visit, we shall all of us benefit.'"
The old eunuch felt around in the small of his back and pressed lightly.
"But when he saw Wang's face, sleep disappeared from the staffer's eyes and was replaced by fear."
"'So you make a habit of coming here and taking food, do you?'"
Human emotions are not simple symbols that can be called up at will.
No one could successfully track me.
The young man who shared the shack with her cousin asked her in.
"Nobody in the house was interested in his stories—nobody, that is, except Wu Peizhen."
"It looked silly and shameless, and whenever she saw him, she just couldn't help getting angry."
'She said they don't really belong to the family but were adopted into the clan years ago when your grandfather and theirs were working in the same office.
"You can look as much as you like, but I'm going to take a nap now in the room over there."
What would have been poor self-esteem was replaced by a kind of modesty—modesty ruled by a practical spirit.
I shan't be able to sit with them myself.'
"'It's easy for you to sit on your backside and talk,' said Gou-er rudely, 'but what do you expect me to do?"
You could at least have lent to one of the Wen brothers!'
At night Chen Qingyang and I would make love in my small hut.
I thought I would wait for the young mistress to come back and explain it all to her.
He couldn't do anything about it.
"'When it is time for you to see her, we shall come in and fetch you'; and they went off with the other servants to greet their mistress."
"Now, it's the scramble to develop mobile communications networks and cell towers."
"When she walked, swinging her arms freely, her body swayed like a willow in the wind."
"The winds were picking up, bending the sorghum stalks in ever deeper waves, those on the roadside stretching out to bow their respects to Grandma."
"All around were thatch-covered shacks surrounded by small unmarked trails that extended in different directions, making it virtually impossible to find one's way."
"Then suddenly he drove his elbows hard into Trinket's ribs, and Trinket went reeling over on to the floor, screaming with pain, certain that he must have several broken bones."
This was one occasion when even Wu Peizhen saw through Wang Qiyao.
It was then that she began to calm down and her tensions eased.
Wang could tell from the one-sided conversation that he was trying to get in touch with the Ürümqi radio astronomy observatory.
He promised to put Wang Qiyao in a scene in one of his movies as soon as the opportunity arose.
"Trinket reached out frantically as he fell, clutching at the boy's legs, and the two of them went down together."
We're here to build up our country's borderland.
"Grandma, still seated in the carriage, felt a sudden breath of cold air that raised tiny goosebumps on her skin."
"'Relations don't come to see us much nowadays,' said Xi-feng affably."
"If he gets me on the ground again tomorrow, I'll die of shame!"
The city turned into many hazy glowing halos.
"Three months later, a bridal sedan chair would come to carry her away."
'Now you are really being too hard on us!
"Well, if it ever comes to a slanging match, she can talk down ten grown men any day of the week!"
"Servants in the yard outside dutifully took up the cry, 'Master Rong, you're wanted back again!'"
"He had a choking sensation in his chest, and could hardly breathe."
"'I live, you die!' laughed Misty, striding into the room."
"It was covered with bowls and dishes containing all kinds of meat and fish, only one or two of which appeared to have been touched."
"He leapt to his feet again, crying: 'So you know the Bucking Antelope too!'"
"Trinket went back to bed, and fell asleep dreaming of Misty surrendering to the Little White Dragon!"
"He couldn't decipher more than a word or two, let alone book titles."
"The path was so narrow in places it was barely passable, causing the wormy, sappy leaves to brush noisily against the sedan chair."
"At least my project only depends on satellite data and has nothing to do with these 'tourist attractions.'"""
She noticed the glow emitting from the electric lamp and the rippling shadows of the lotus-shaped lampshade projecting onto the three walls of the set.
These people are all eunuchs working for the Emperor. . .'
He helped himself to a cake.
But I don't see the point: you'll never be able to beat me!'
"At those moments, I felt it was unnecessary to prove my existence."
The director led them into the dressing room and had a makeup artist work on Wang Qiyao.
"Equally ill at ease, Aroma giggled softly."
This uncle was the black sheep of the family.
"An hour later, Wang arrived at the new planetarium and got out of the car."
"Shortly after leaving the village, the lazy musicians stopped playing, while the bearers quickened their pace."
Ban-er at once hid himself behind her back and neither threats nor blandishments would induce him to come out and make a bow to his 'Auntie'.
'I wonder where they get the food from?
"I used to believe that Chen Qingyang would come to see me immediately after I went up the mountain, but I was wrong."
No longer did it seem like a wedding procession as they negotiated the dirt road; it was more like a funeral procession.
"He ducked under the table, just in case it turned out to be someone other than Misty."
"Equally ill at ease, Aroma giggled softly."
'I didn't want anyone to recognize me taking the cake.'
"'It's easy for you to sit on your backside and talk,' said Gou-er rudely, 'but what do you expect me to do?"
I'd suggest you not pursue it after this.
After that I was angry and upset.
The gentlemen ignored her request and returned to their discussion.
Wang Qiyao did not sleep well the night before; her face appeared thinner than usual and she had dark rings around her eyes.
She reached out to lift it a crack – Great-Granddad had told her not to remove her red veil.
It never crossed my mind that I didn't look back as I walked.
Jia Rong flashed a winning smile at her and half-knelt on the side of the kang.
The boy groaned and staggered back a few steps.
'What's your name?' asked the boy.
"They were both getting anxious, feeling that the whole trip was a mistake."
"The curtain, embroidered on the inside with a dragon and a phoenix, had faded after years of use, and there was a large stain in the middle."
"It was three or four o'clock, the sunlight was waning and the wind picked up, rustling their skirts."
But I just wonder if I can beat him.'
"'Just stay here, Grannie,' they said."
"In Yangzhou he'd seen all sorts of plays, but the eunuchs on stage were never dressed anything like Old Hai, or his new gambling friend Wu."
"'Hand over the toll, or I'll pop you all!'"
"A few minutes later, a red waveform appeared in the browser window, moving in step with the other three."
"During 1912, the first year of the Republic, professional mourners known as 'wailers' came from Qufu, the home of Confucius, to study local weeping techniques."
"As a young maiden, she had embroidered a wedding trousseau and several exquisite pictures for the man who would someday become my granddad."
"A grandfather had held some very small official post in the capital and had there become acquainted with Wang Xi-feng's grandfather, the father of Lady Wang."
"I know that as the universe cooled after the big bang, the leftover 'embers' became the cosmic microwave background."
They began rocking the chair so violently that poor Grandma couldn't keep her seat without holding on tight.
"Not only did he remember them, he addressed them jocularly as ""the girls from So-and-so middle school""—Wang Qiyao and Wu Peizhen turned a bright red."
Old Hai heaved a strangely unconcerned sigh.
I must tell you that the weeping of women from Northeast Gaomi Township makes beautiful music.
"She leaned back languidly in her chair and said, That's a great idea."
"'Hand over the toll, or I'll pop you all!'"
But Xi-feng laughed quite unconcernedly and told Patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string of cash to go with it.
'Then get up ... and fight!'
"Sitting in a chair and listening to the sound of the wind, Chen Qingyang would look back at what happened and begin to have doubts about everything."
"The universe itself was transparent; as long as you were sufficiently sharp-eyed, you could see as far as you liked."
"Equipment for receiving satellite data was squeezed into the main computer room, and three terminals displayed the information sent by the three satellites."
"With the students from Beijing on one side and the country boys on the other, everyone chose a weapon, either a wooden stick or a leather belt."
Both of them felt a bit gloomy and Wu Peizhen fell silent.
"This was also what Wang Qiyao thought at first, but once she reached that stage everything changed."
He treated Wu Peizhen as if she were a child; he loved to tease her and play little jokes on her.
I waited for a long time and then decided to give up.
"'Yes, Aunt,' said Jia Rong, and pursing his lips up in a complacent smile he sauntered slowly out of the room."
Why should we put up with casual slander?
"When I made love to Chen Qingyang, a lizard crawled out of a crack in the wall and crossed the ground in the middle of the room, moving intermittently."
I felt very strange after I heard her words.
"Grandma stopped crying at the sound of the woodwind, as though commanded from on high."
There was no doubt about it.
"He suddenly thought of something, and added: 'If I did get caught, I'd never dream of dragging you into it, Goong-goong!'"
"""That is ... a fantastical legend."""
"When I walked into Chen Qingyang's clinic, I carried so many things on my back that my pack was overflowing."
"Just at that moment Chen Qingyang's moans flooded out, filling the entire room."
What was it he sent us for?
"He ducked under the table, just in case it turned out to be someone other than Misty."
She laughed hard for a while and said she simply couldn't bear the sight of that thing on my body.
"""Didn't you tell us that you are always running into all these big name stars at the studio every day?"" she protested."
Your family used to be connected with the Wang clan of Nanking.
No one will connect it to my nanotech research.
All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets.
"It was a Nanjing-style bed with ornate flower patterns carved into the woodwork, a mirror set into the headboard, and high bed curtains all around—all the signs of rustic elegance."
"Not only did he remember them, he addressed them jocularly as ""the girls from So-and-so middle school""—Wang Qiyao and Wu Peizhen turned a bright red."
"Then you're to lend them money, the more the better."
"Yet at the time she just took off her white smock, sat beside me, and stared at my little Buddha, thinking he was the color of a burn scar."
He returned home to vent some of his spleen on his long-suffering wife.
Aroma stared at him curiously and continued to giggle.
What does it all amount to?
That's five orders of magnitude longer than the wavelength of visible light.
"Trinket fell for it and dodged, and as he did so, the boy's elbow came crashing across into his midriff and winded him completely."
"They were both getting anxious, feeling that the whole trip was a mistake."
He couldn't do anything about it.
"""That is ... a fantastical legend."""
Did you catch us in the act?
"As he dragged the strings of coins into a pile with his foot, his eyes were fixed on Grandma."
Trinket peeped out from behind the table-cloth.
"But you must have some basic understanding of the cosmic microwave background?"""
"The inside of the sedan chair was badly worn and terribly dirty, like a coffin; it had already embraced countless other brides, now long dead."
"I found that I could not manage three women's work, especially when my back hurt."
She turned to Zhou Rui's wife.
"With a good deal of girlish simpering Grannie Liu sat down again, perching herself obliquely on the extreme edge of the kang."
It's up to us to think of something.
We aren't some criminals in exile.
"When I fed the pigs for the production team, every day I had to carry buckets of water."
"From then on Bao-yu treated Aroma with even greater consideration than before, whilst Aroma for her part redoubled the devotion with which she served him."
'I'm just happy about. . . about remembering it the minute you mentioned it again.'
Zhou Rui's wife hurriedly rose to her feet and urged Grannie Liu to do likewise.
I felt very strange after I heard her words.
"At their girls' school, where rumors usually flew rampant, not a soul knew about Wang Qiyao's screen test; they had succeeded in keeping it completely under wraps."
"Some time later on, when you have nothing better to do, look in on us for a day or two for kinship's sake."
Old Hai reached out his hand and pressed lightly on either side of Trinket's neck.
Trinket leapt on him from behind and gripped him tightly round the throat with both his hands.
Not until much later did I finally figure out how much she had really taken to heart being called damaged goods.
"Misty toppled over, and Trinket punched him in the small of the back."
'Give in my arse!' panted Trinket back.
"When he heard this, Luo Xiaosi couldn't help crying."
"Then, after glancing cautiously around, began again."
Grandma was sweating profusely and her heart was racing as she listened to the rhythmic footsteps and heavy breathing of the bearers.
"Chen Qingyang told him that since everyone said he didn't exist, maybe he didn't."
"From deep in the sorghum came the melancholy croaks of toads, the dreary chirps of grasshoppers, and the plaintive howls of foxes."
"If they try to fob you off, you tell them that I'll report them to the Chief Librarian;"
Wu Peizhen caught her cousin in a lie.
"But she pinched my leg and said: Hurry, you idiot!"
She dreamed of an elegantly dressed woman under the mercury-vapor lamps.
Aroma stared at him curiously and continued to giggle.
"By drinking to allay his anxiety, Gou-er merely put himself more out of temper."
Misty gave a cry of pain and bent double.
The sleepy-eyed planetarium staffer was waiting by the door for Wang.
Sha was excited to see Wang.
The wavelength of the cosmic microwave background is seven centimeters.
"The sacrificial choking sounds from inside the chair and the woodwind accompaniment had made them restless and uneasy, had set their souls adrift."
"I know that as the universe cooled after the big bang, the leftover 'embers' became the cosmic microwave background."
"The day before, Wu Peizhen had agreed to take Wang Qiyao to have a look around the studio."
"He leapt to his feet again, crying: 'So you know the Bucking Antelope too!'"
"The sacrificial choking sounds from inside the chair and the woodwind accompaniment had made them restless and uneasy, had set their souls adrift."
"It turned out not only did I live, but I wasn't even paralyzed, which was a good thing for me though she wasn't crazy about it."
"If I'd died, or become paralyzed, it would have then been morally justified."
Misty seemed somewhat taken aback by this but then concurred.
"From now on, if such great fluctuations occur, the data will be automatically saved to disk."""
You take young Ban-er with you and ask for Old Zhou that stayed in service with your lady after she married.
They continued to speak for a while.
"Impatiently trying to conjure up an image of their firm, muscular chests, Grandma raised the toe of her shoe and leaned forward."
I did not leave that night—Chen Qingyang caught me and asked me to stay in the name of our great friendship.
"However, after making friends with Wang Qiyao, she became more thoughtful."
Sha stared at Wang for a long time and then nodded.
Then they went to an all-night bar for tourists and sat for two hours.
Give our regards to everybody who ought to be remembered when you get back!'
"She admitted that she'd been wrong to slap me, and that she hadn't treated me well."
I was the only one left feeding those pigs.
Wang tried to interpret the flickers as Morse code.
"It was abundantly clear to Xi-feng that the old lady was too embarrassed to go on, and she put her out of her misery with a gracious smile."
"The wind got under her clothes and flowed all over her body, like caresses and lips."
"A heavy bracelet of twisted silver slid down to her wrist, and as she looked at the coiled-snake design her thoughts grew chaotic and disoriented."
"Ninety-two hours had already elapsed, and only 1,108 hours remained."
"As Trinket rolled and spun round, he managed to pin Misty face down on the floor."
"And there was Chen Qingyang, who said that I hurried down the mountain in my green fatigues."
That should fix the little bugger!'
"When the wave receded, I would rest calmly, but I wanted to dance while the wave was at its peak."
"With his hand resting on his belt, he shuffled up to the sedan chair, reached out, and pinched Grandma's foot."
"Even when he accused me of playing dumb, I still said nothing."
"As he went, he found himself thinking of Whiskers' heroic stand at Victory Hill: now there was a man!"
"The confessions would reach a point when the audience, unable to restrain themselves, their faces twisted into hundreds of masks of lust, would shout, Tie her up!"
It's up to us to think of something.
People told him that I wasn't a mute.
"It was time to rest, so the bearers lowered the sedan chair to the ground."
Wang pushed away the pile of papers filled with waveforms.
It will be just the same as if you were to say it to Her Ladyship.'
It had the power to make what was dark and dismal glimmer with light.
"So to make peace, she softened her tone and said, ""Anyway, he is breathtakingly ugly—don't you agree?"""
He didn't want to discuss the subject any further.
"By the time Luo Xiaosi left, Chen Qingyang was confused."
"You can look as much as you like, but I'm going to take a nap now in the room over there."
"Things faded off into the distance, never to reappear, as if they had been an illusion."
"Succumbing to the oppressiveness in the carriage, Grandma eased one of her bamboo-shoot toes under the curtain and lifted it a crack to sneak a look outside."
Trinket held on and demanded triumphantly: 'Surrender?'
'I wonder if Grannie has eaten yet today?'
"I told him that I didn't have anything (food, utensils, etc.), so I couldn't go to the thermal springs."
"If you don't mind it being so little, you are very welcome to take it.'"
'Eyes straight ahead if you want to keep breathing!'
"When I walked into Chen Qingyang's clinic, I carried so many things on my back that my pack was overflowing."
'Give in my arse!' panted Trinket back.
"As Wang left, Sha said, ""I won't go with you."
He thumped the object tucked into his belt.
"They had both been quite carried away by the fighting, and neither of them had mentioned the money, or the bet they had laid."
"At those moments, I felt it was unnecessary to prove my existence."
"Wang avoided giving a straight answer, and Sha didn't press."
"No problem, since I'm working the night shift, anyway."
"He had a choking sensation in his chest, and could hardly breathe."
The aroma of sorghum burrowed into her heart.
"He'd just been improvising and thrashing around, and somehow or other had managed to outwit his opponent."
"He was about to boast, but thought better of it."
'What's your name?' asked the boy.
"My man's is collecting the half-yearly rents in the spring and autumn; and when he's not doing that, he takes the young masters out when they go on visits."
"But his eyes roamed, trying to capture other sights."
We didn't have a stitch on while we argued.
But Sha then deprived him of this last glimmer of hope.
The cousin was the son of Wu Peizhen's uncle on her mother's side.
I went over to tell him that the buffalo had been bitten by a poisonous snake and couldn't work.
"Captain Shi Qiang stood there, blowing out a mouthful of white smoke."
"'Oh Grannie, you have no idea!' said Zhou Rui's wife."
"After you've made such a long pilgrimage, we won't let you go home without seeing a real Buddha!"
'But it's a long time since you had anything to do with him and hard to say how he may prove after all these years.
The city turned into many hazy glowing halos.
"We made more than twenty pairs."""
"The two eggs she'd eaten for breakfast churned in her stomach, the flies buzzed around her ears; her throat tightened, as the taste of eggs surged up into her mouth."
So she made it sound like she would only be punished for what she had just done.
'Don't mind him; just stay where you are!
"The song was ""Come, Gracious Spirit, Heavenly Dove."""
You should never let other people keep you in mind.
"""Can you print out the waveform?"" Wang asked."
Jia Rong flashed a winning smile at her and half-knelt on the side of the kang.
"One of the bearers up front imitated the trumpet sound, evoking coarse, raucous laughter all around."
"Of course the Wen brothers won't let you see His Majesty; when they take you, His Majesty won't even be in the Upper Library."
Wang Qiyao's heart raced and her hands grew clammy.
"Whatever brought him to our team, I made up my mind to stay mute."
"Then, bawling over the wall, 'Mrs Zhou, there's an old woman come to see you!'"
Wang opened the suitcase on the backseat of his car and took out a pair of 3K glasses.
'What did you want to wrap your face up for?'
"When she had a husband before, he did this to her every day."
"However, I wasn't feeling happy at all."
"When the sedan chair reached the plains, the bearers began to get a little sloppy, both to make up time and to torment their passenger."
Thunder rumbled off to the northeast.
But you want to see a five percent fluctuation tonight?
"And so, that very evening, the matter was settled."
"Never!' protested Trinket, but when he tried to straighten himself up and get to his feet, he felt a sudden numbness in the small of his back."
'Then you should have found a way to offer one.
Chen Qingyang didn't give me the information because she didn't care about it—she was not one of the city students.
"But she said my great friendship was phony, and the reason I had tricked her into coming was to study her anatomy."
"As I passed the village well, I saw the military deputy at the well stand brushing his teeth."
Later he said he was not going to arrange a denouncing meeting but a helping meeting.
"Ever a crafty fighter, Trinket now let go of the boy's legs, got behind him, and landed him a good kick on the backside."
"If we can't shake any words loose, we can at least shake the piss out of her!'"
"'I wouldn't say that,' said Grannie Liu."
"I shoved him right in the chest, pushing him down on his butt."
Frogs and toads croaked in loud welcome to the oncoming summer rainstorm.
Trinket let out a gasp of pain.
"In the days following their visit to the film studio, Wang Qiyao did not utter a single word about their trip, and this left Wu Peizhen quite depressed."
She had no problem with that.
"After Shan Tingxiu had spotted Grandma, a stream of people came to congratulate Great-Granddad and Great-Grandma."
"I don't need you to teach me, either."
"'Now,' went on Old Hai, 'if you go stealing books from the Upper Library, you've got to be very smart, very careful."
"'He was bigger than me, and stronger."
"That morning, right at dawn, I went down the mountain to feed the pigs."
"Maybe it would be better if the observatories were built in places farther away from cities?"""
"'It's just that. . . what with killing that boy yesterday, I can't seem to think straight, it must have gone clean out of my mind."
"That's the sort of person a lady like that calls ""nephew"" ."
"If there had been no Wang Er to tell her the route, she wouldn't have been able to find such a tiny hut in the vast, wild mountains."
"'Now where we live may be out in the country, but it's still ""in the Emperor's shadow"", as they say."
Thus an equilibrium of give-and-take was maintained between the two girls and they grew closer by the day.
Or maybe it signals the end of the whole world.
'We are getting to be quite strangers with everybody.
"'I can see you've never done any wrestling,' laughed Misty."
Trinket held on and demanded triumphantly: 'Surrender?'
Even her teeth began to chatter.
"'Yes, Goong-goong!' piped Trinket, thinking to himself, 'Just say it once, and I'll never forget it, not in a hundred years!'"
That's what wresding's all about!' laughed Misty.
"Trinket noticed at once that he was wearing a completely new outfit, and couldn't help feeling jealous."
"That was why when Luo Xiaosi asked him where Wang Er had gone, he said, Wang Er?"
"The boy quickly grabbed his right leg and tugged at it, sending Trinket crashing down on his back."
But they had yet to lay eyes on anyone who looked like a movie star.
They say that now she's getting on in years she's grown even more charitable and given to good works than she was as a girl.
Twenty years ago the Nanking Wangs used to be very good to you folk.
"If you want to see it show the kind of fluctuation observable by the naked eye, you might have to wait until long after the death of the sun."""
He crumpled up and fell to the ground in excruciating pain.
Trinket had soon managed to win over twenty taels off them.
She laughed hard for a while and said she simply couldn't bear the sight of that thing on my body.
Jia Rong saluted his aunt Manchu fashion.
"The rain beat a loud tattoo on the sedan chair and fell on Grandma's embroidered slippers; it fell on Yu Zhan'ao's head, then slanted in on Grandma's face."
"At that moment, her feeling for Wang Qiyao approached maternal love—a love that encompassed all."
"The two girls were left straggling behind, holding hands, trying their best to keep up."
"A yard in length, the cloth bindings were wound around all but the big toes until the bones cracked and the toes turned under."
"The entire sky flickered, as if the universe was but a quivering lamp in the wind."
These were things I didn't want to hear.
In actual fact he'd won twenty and lent twelve to Wu: the remaining eight he wished to hang on to.
"When he had finished eating, he went through the motions of practising with the dice so as not to arouse the old eunuch's suspicions, throwing them noisily across the table."
The countdown continued at the scale of the universe.
"'Well, of course, first and foremost we came to see you,' replied Grannie Liu mendaciously, 'but we were also hoping to pay our respects to Her Ladyship."
It will be just the same as if you were to say it to Her Ladyship.'
'Nobody passes without paying a toll!' the man bellowed.
"One of the musicians raised his trumpet and brought it down hard on the highwayman's skull, burying the curved edge so deeply he had to strain to free it."
"'If it's the tiniest bit chipped,' said Xi-feng, 'I'll have the hide off you!'"
"The grandfather had long since died, leaving an only son called Wang Cheng who, having fallen on hard times, had moved back into the countryside somewhere outside the capital."
Suddenly a thought occurred to him.
"'Could this be the Palace, the Forbidden City itself!' he thought silently to himself."
We're here to build up our country's borderland.
What does it all amount to?
"Servants in the yard outside dutifully took up the cry, 'Master Rong, you're wanted back again!'"
The urchin stared back at her impudently.
She says please thank them very much for coming.
"If you could take us to see her, that would be very nice; but if that's not possible, perhaps we could trouble you just to give her our regards.'"
"The young men of his generation were as sturdy as Northeast Gaomi sorghum, which is more than can be said about us weaklings who succeeded them."
"'It's just that. . . what with killing that boy yesterday, I can't seem to think straight, it must have gone clean out of my mind."
"Grannie Liu, acutely embarrassed in this male presence, did not know whether to sit or stand, and looked round her in vain for somewhere to hide herself."
"Trinket was about to snatch the bandages back, when he reflected that the boy had already seen most of his face and that it would achieve nothing."
She only has to feel well disposed and a hair off her arm would be thicker than a man's waist to poor folks like us!'
"Right now, our only choice is to find technical means to shield against interference."
Which part of the Palace was he from?'
"'It's easy for you to sit on your backside and talk,' said Gou-er rudely, 'but what do you expect me to do?"
"'Yes, I'll try it out tomorrow."
"Although on the outside she looks like a grownup, deep down she is still a child!"
Maybe her girlfriends had made it all up.
But they did not see a soul who even faintly resembled a movie star.
Trinket didn't follow this at all.
"He doesn't even work in the Upper Library, dammit!"
'Nobody passes without paying a toll!'
"In the end, he still couldn't get anything out of me."
"Standing there like an angry cobra, the thing was indeed homely."
"But he never apologized, and then he went to prison."
"They either had messy, disheveled hair or, if they had just walked out of the beauty salon, hair that look like a helmet."
"If we delay a moment longer, people will start coming in with messages and we shan't have a chance to speak to her."
"An hour later, Wang arrived at the new planetarium and got out of the car."
What way could there be of laying my hands on some money?
"Qin-shi was surprised to hear Bao-yu call out her childhood name in his sleep, but did not like to pursue the matter."
"At home she had hidden a pair of scissors in her bodice, perhaps to use on Shan Bianlang, perhaps to use on herself."
After a moment's hesitation the boy replied: 'Mine's . . .
"He struggled to understand all the messages, and felt the passing of the countdown, second by second."
She was afraid that Wang Qiyao had not liked the studio and the whole trip had been a complete waste.
Then one day the director telephoned Wang Qiyao at home to have her come down to the studio for a screen test.
Only then did Wu Peizhen cool down a bit.
"On the contrary, she even felt a bit bad for Wu Peizhen—because she was so ugly."
Then she checked my back and her diagnosis was the same as mine.
"Chen Qingyang told him that since everyone said he didn't exist, maybe he didn't."
"The musicians, as though snapping out of a trance, struck up their instruments."
'Have you told Her Ladyship yet?'
Once again the technical people were doing all the work while the actors did virtually nothing.
During the previous few takes the light had been marked by an unbridled brilliance.
"She told me to return that evening, and we'd try it one more time."
"'That's where she lives,' he said, pointing in the direction of a side wall."
"It wasn't Sunday, so it was likely a choir rehearsal."
Give our regards to everybody who ought to be remembered when you get back!'
The people who built huts on the hills and lived there year-round were usually patients with a variety of diseases.
She knew that any of those paths would take her to me.
"The director was disappointed, but his disappointment was partly for Wang Qiyao's sake."
"Until my twenty-first birthday I was a virgin, but that night I lured Chen Qingyang up the mountain with me."
"From deep in the sorghum came the melancholy croaks of toads, the dreary chirps of grasshoppers, and the plaintive howls of foxes."
"'We knew you had your troubles,' she said, 'but as the saying goes, ""A starved camel is bigger than a fat horse."""
"'Hey!' screamed Trinket, 'that's not fair!"
"I always expected Chen Qingyang to come to see me, but she never came."
"The uninfected patients all fled to their homes to recuperate, and the doctors went down to the production team to provide medical care."
'What are you so happy about?' snapped the old eunuch.
"'How are you, my dear?' said Grannie Liu, advancing with a smile."
"Yu Zhan'ao looked wordlessly first at the dead, then at the living."
"The winds were picking up, bending the sorghum stalks in ever deeper waves, those on the roadside stretching out to bow their respects to Grandma."
Wang could hear his rapid breathing.
Aroma had always been an intelligent girl.
"'Why, he's just another scavenger like me!' thought Trinket to himself."
"'Tell me, sonny, is there a Mrs Zhou living here?'"
The new boy was clearly tucking in.
"Forget this time, and I shall kill you.'"
"And the stage eunuchs always held those long horsehair fly-whisks, and kept waving them around in the air."
After a while I walked away again.
"'I know plenty more, and they're a lot worse."
"'She has come all this way today to pay her respects,' she concluded."
"They walked along the row of antenna dishes, and Sha pointed to them."
What way could there be of laying my hands on some money?
"To prove the indisputable fact, I went down the mountain the day the relief delegation arrived and took part in the delegation's hearing."
"Trinket recalled Whiskers' fight with the seven wrestlers at the inn, and shot out a quick left that caught the boy hard, fair and square, on the lower cheek."
"The cold weather was beginning, but none of the preparations for winter had yet been made."
"The city students said, That's bullshit!"
'But they didn't ask me for a loan.'
"""I must get my hands on a pair before five."""
"Now, he'd said he would fight, and there could be no going back!"
"The inside of the sedan chair was badly worn and terribly dirty, like a coffin; it had already embraced countless other brides, now long dead."
'I have something to say to you.
Thus an equilibrium of give-and-take was maintained between the two girls and they grew closer by the day.
"I think it was back in the sixties when two Americans accidentally discovered the radiation when they were testing a supersensitive satellite reception antenna—"""
I wouldn't need to learn much to beat him.
"When the lights came back on, everything seemed different."
Full-voiced strange and rare birds sang to her from the fields.
These people are all eunuchs working for the Emperor. . .'
"The confessions would reach a point when the audience, unable to restrain themselves, their faces twisted into hundreds of masks of lust, would shout, Tie her up!"
"If things get really bad, I can simply run the hell away."
"So, without a very important reason, her visiting me would be the act of a woman who was truly damaged goods."
"""Didn't you tell us that you are always running into all these big name stars at the studio every day?"" she protested."
'I didn't think it would be hard.
"Temporarily speechless with wonder, Grannie Liu stood wagging her head, alternating clicks of admiration with pious ejaculations."
'Listen: you're to win money from the Wen brothers.
"The confessions would reach a point when the audience, unable to restrain themselves, their faces twisted into hundreds of masks of lust, would shout, Tie her up!"
"Yet, when she shared her anxieties with her parents, Great-Granddad hemmed and hawed, while Great-Grandma scolded the girlfriends, accusing them of sour grapes."
But Sha then deprived him of this last glimmer of hope.
"The line's color became red, like a snake awakening after hibernation, wriggling as its skin refilled with blood."
"Everything up to that point boils down to preparation and foreshadowing, but what happens afterward?"
"She was aware of everything going on around her, down to the shouts of ""Camera"" coming from the adjacent set."
It's only because of late years you have been too stiff-necked to approach them that they have become more distant with you.
"The universe itself was transparent; as long as you were sufficiently sharp-eyed, you could see as far as you liked."
Grannie Liu waddled up to them and offered a respectful salutation.
She said it was nice of them to come and see us today and we should be careful to treat them considerately.
"The initial onslaught was met by screams and shrill cries, which soon died out."
'I lent it yesterday to someone else.'
It was the second time that I made love to Chen Qingyang.
He said that's the way it goes around here.
He can throw me a few times— I'll soon get the hang of it.'
Grandma was sweating profusely and her heart was racing as she listened to the rhythmic footsteps and heavy breathing of the bearers.
"I said, since you don't even want to look at him, let's just forget the whole thing."
"By the time Wu Peizhen got home, her family was already at the dinner table and she had to fib about where she had been."
"The nurse said they shouldn't try to move me since my back was broken, and I'd be done for."
"Sorghum plants lining the road shone like ebony, dense and impenetrable; weeds and wildflowers grew in such profusion they seemed to block the road."
"It was real, not dramatic—the kind of beauty that people noticed on the street and photo studios displayed in their front windows."
"It's late now, so I won't try to keep you."
"The bearers lowered the sedan chair to the ground, took out their copper coins, and did the same."
'Where did that stuff come from?'
"'I wonder what that can be,' she thought to herself, 'and what it can be used for?'"
"So, without a very important reason, her visiting me would be the act of a woman who was truly damaged goods."
"She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one."
"They wouldn't miss a little thing like that, or expect me to pay for it!'"
The men's bodies emitted the sour smell of sweat.
Who's going to all that trouble just to make a fool of themselves?'
"The initial onslaught was met by screams and shrill cries, which soon died out."
"Originally there had been three women to do the job, but now the team leader assigned it all to me."
"That was why when Luo Xiaosi asked him where Wang Er had gone, he said, Wang Er?"
"The set locations may have been dilapidated and in disrepair, but the images captured by the camera were always perfectly beautiful."
"They won't believe it if you tell them, but it's true."
"But you must have some basic understanding of the cosmic microwave background?"""
"The elder Miss Wang was a very straightforward young lady, very easy to get on with, and not at all high and mighty."
Your family used to be connected with the Wang clan of Nanking.
"His curiosity aroused, Trinket poked his head out from under the table."
He went into the dim interior of the planetarium.
"Sedan bearers and musicians are low-class rowdies capable of anything, no matter how depraved."
'If only I'd taken old Whiskers up on his offer!
Misty laughed and set him free.
"Trinket lost his balance, tottered and fell, bringing Misty down with him."
Do you realize what that would mean?
Trinket hopped out of bed and was at Old Hai's bedside in a trice.
We aren't some criminals in exile.
I said I was going to the Qingping thermal springs to bathe.
"How many times Trinket had sat listening to the storytellers' tales, and how many times he'd dreamed of one day being a hero himself—Trinket the Brave Man and True!"
"Nobody in the house was interested in his stories—nobody, that is, except Wu Peizhen."
Then he heard the flip-ploy of cloth boots again.
"They wouldn't miss a little thing like that, or expect me to pay for it!'"
All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets.
"Even if I did have rich friends or relations, I'm not so sure they would want to be bothered with the likes of us.'"
"At least my project only depends on satellite data and has nothing to do with these 'tourist attractions.'"""
"""It was only recently revealed that she had spent more than twenty years at Red Coast Base."""
"If you tell them you've come to see him, it will give you an excuse for the visit."
"Don't throw up, don't let yourself throw up! she commanded herself."
"One of the bearers up front imitated the trumpet sound, evoking coarse, raucous laughter all around."
I must try and get a look.
"'Stop her, Zhou dear !' said Xi-feng in alarm."
The servants there don't know me; it would be a journey wasted.'
"Yu Zhan'ao reached down, took the thing from the man's belt, and shook off the red cloth covering, to reveal the gnarled knot of a tree."
"But Wang became anxious, and his mind kept returning to that green line on the terminal in Sha's office."
"Observing the condition that Bao-yu was in, she therefore had more than an inkling of what had happened."
"'If you want to stop him bucking you, that's easy!' said Old Hai."
Grandma ripped the curtain from the front of the carriage and stuffed it behind the seat.
A trumpet blared from behind the chair:
Wu Peizhen could hardly bring herself to look Wang Qiyao in the eye.
They raised clouds of dust as they tramped along.
I kicked him into a manure pit right in front of the cattle pen for a shit bath.
"In the pale white light of dawn, the church's Romanesque vaults appeared as three giant fingers pointing out something in space for him."
She turned to Zhou Rui's wife.
"The musicians, as though snapping out of a trance, struck up their instruments."
The sleepy-eyed planetarium staffer was waiting by the door for Wang.
"After struggling futilely for a moment longer, he finally gave up."
"In this perverse world, that would be a relief."
It would be strange indeed if we didn't have a few!'
"Just then one of the bearers spoke up: 'You there, little bride in the chair, say something!"
The right dial is for adjusting brightness.
We can let you have it back again as soon as he has gone.'
Zhou Rui's wife came hurrying out and asked who it was.
"He realized that these were sources of radiation in the centimeter range, all now converted to visible light."
"Chen Qingyang said that when she decided to head up the mountain to search for me, she didn't have anything on under her white smock."
"It wasn't Sunday, so it was likely a choir rehearsal."
I shan't be able to sit with them myself.'
Patience stood beside her carrying a covered teacup on a tiny inlaid lacquer tray.
Their next stop was a three-walled hotel lobby where a fight scene was being shot.
They arrived back at the lab at one.
Perhaps she was also suffering from insomnia.
The money was set down in front of Grannie Liu.
'It's hard times that keeps us away.
"Succumbing to the oppressiveness in the carriage, Grandma eased one of her bamboo-shoot toes under the curtain and lifted it a crack to sneak a look outside."
"My little Buddha still stuck out, glittering in the moonlight as if wrapped in plastic."
"After the vixen knocked me out with a stool, Chen Qingyang ran all the way down the mountain to see me."
"As Trinket rolled and spun round, he managed to pin Misty face down on the floor."
"But as my old face is tough enough to stand a slap or two, it's up to me to go."
Then she checked my back and her diagnosis was the same as mine.
"Abandoning her question, she busied herself with his clothes, her cheeks suffused by a crimson blush of embarrassment."
"She was, in any case, a year or two older than Bao-yu and had recently begun to have some understanding of the facts of life."
He was wearing a pair of glasses and a set of coarse cotton clothes.
"But I just stared at him, like a wild boar, like an idiot, like a male cat staring at a female one, until his anger vanished under my stare."
"First, there were the paging stations during the eighties."
"He saw a line of twenty-eight parabolic antenna dishes, each with a diameter of nine meters, like a row of spectacular steel plants."
She raised the curtain to get a glimpse of the man who ate fistcakes.
The boy crashed down right on top of him.
Wang Miao drove along Jingmi Road until he was in Miyun County.
"We've complained to the State Regulatory Radio Commission many times, never with any results."
"The cousin told them all this as he led them off to see the special effects shoot, where they saw smoke, fire, even ghosts."
Yu Zhan'ao lifted Grandma into the sedan chair.
"Good, then I'll take you on a tour."""
"He came tumbling back, wrapped both arms round the boy's legs, and tugged at him with all his might."
"'Sit down,' said Xi-feng with a smile."
"I always expected Chen Qingyang to come to see me, but she never came."
The delicate powder of petals floated above silvery new ears of waving sorghum.
People were so afraid of this kind of damaged-goods behavior in broad daylight that they didn't even dare talk about it.
The red light had come from more than ten billion years ago.
"Since they stuffed the rolled flatbreads into their mouths with both fists, they were called 'fistcakes'."
"Grannie Liu slipped off the kang, lifted down Ban-er, and exchanged a few hurried whispers with her in the reception room before waddling into the room beyond."
Who's going to all that trouble just to make a fool of themselves?'
He plugged in a network cable and picked up the phone.
"Unable to overcome her curiosity, Chen Qingyang finally dropped everything and went up the mountain to look for me."
Sha took out a notebook computer and rushed to turn it on.
Maybe her girlfriends had made it all up.
"Say what you like, a hair plucked from your arm is thicker than a man's waist to folks like us!'"
"He realized that these were sources of radiation in the centimeter range, all now converted to visible light."
"When he had finished eating, he went through the motions of practising with the dice so as not to arouse the old eunuch's suspicions, throwing them noisily across the table."
"He also arranged for people to trail Chen Qingyang and me, trying to catch us in the act of adultery."
"Grandma was lightheaded and dizzy inside the stuffy sedan chair, her view blocked by a red curtain that gave off a pungent mildewy odour."
They began rocking the chair so violently that poor Grandma couldn't keep her seat without holding on tight.
"She felt humiliated; she could sense the perils of her future, knowing she'd spend the rest of her life drowning in a sea of bitterness."
'Hold it right there!' the highwayman commanded feebly.
"""In recent years, commercial operation of basic research has been fairly successful, like in high-energy physics."
"'This is the Grannie Liu I was just telling you about,' said Zhou Rui's wife."
After their eyes adjusted they made out a portion of the warehouse-like room that had been arranged to look like one half of a bedroom.
"He was the director, the cousin later told them."
I should have stuffed a whole plateful in my pocket and buggered off!
They can sit here while they are waiting.'
I sped up and waves of vibration passed through me as if from the earth's core.
You have to knee him on the vital point in the small of his back.
"'I see,' said the boy, chuckling and standing up."
'There was no time to think about eating.'
"If I still didn't agree, he was going to let the widow come after me."
"When she opened her eyes once again and looked, she saw the awkward expression of someone who had no desire to be there."
He was wearing a pair of glasses and a set of coarse cotton clothes.
'Elder brothers . . . spare me . . .'
"First, when you met her, you couldn't get a word out; then, when you did start talking, it was all ""your nephew"" this and ""your nephew"" that!"
At the heart of each halo was a radiation source.
She pulled Wang Qiyao away so they could go look around other parts of the studio.
"But if anyone has important business, bring them in and I will deal with it now.'"
"This time they seemed to be using a specialized lighting, the kind that illuminates a room during a pitch-black night."
So this was what real Palace Eunuchs were like!
"When the day finally arrived, Wu Peizhen's excitement far surpassed that of Wang Qiyao; she could barely contain herself."
Come over here and I'll show you.'
"The curtain, embroidered on the inside with a dragon and a phoenix, had faded after years of use, and there was a large stain in the middle."
"All of a sudden, the lights in the room lit up like a dozen rising suns, blinding them."
"The fifteenth team's water was bitter, and there wasn't much to eat either."
"In the foggy dawn, I left her and went down the mountain to herd buffalo."
The two of them had a good laugh.
"Things faded off into the distance, never to reappear, as if they had been an illusion."
"Later, in order to make things up to her, he had a photographer friend of his do a photo shoot for her—but this photo shoot turned into something quite extraordinary."
Bao-yu blushed furiously and said nothing.
'Elder brothers . . . spare me . . .'
"My grandfather, the bearer directly in front of Grandma's foot, felt a strange premonition blazing inside him and illuminating the path his life would take."
Zhou Rui's wife scrutinized her questioningly for some moments before finally recognizing her.
Grandma pleaded desperately between agonising retches.
"""Nowhere,"" Wu Peizhen casually responded, as she gave Wang Qiyao a knowing pinch on the arm."
"Later she emerged from the gully, walked into a valley facing the sun, and saw a thatched hut that seemed newly built."
It was very much the same sort of technique as the one used by the Manchu wrestlers in the inn the previous day.
"She felt humiliated; she could sense the perils of her future, knowing she'd spend the rest of her life drowning in a sea of bitterness."
"'I see,' said the boy, chuckling and standing up."
"In order to earn some extra income, Sha often played the role of tour guide or gave lectures."
"And since I took over the management of the household, I find there are quite a lot of relations that I don't even know about."
"And now, we can use it to see the universe flicker."""
When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about 'difficulties' she concluded that there was no hope.
"'Well all right then, if you are sure you have nothing to say."
After a while I walked away again.
In that instant her heart began pounding like a drum.
"Yu Zhan'ao approached the highwayman, his thin lips curled resolutely, up at one end and down at the other."
I think you'd better come back to feed the pigs.
Wang Qiyao's heart raced and her hands grew clammy.
'The Antelope is nothing!' he cried.
"Then, after a few days you're to ask them to take you to the Upper Library."
"A change came over the highwayman's face, and he gripped the object at his belt tightly."
"""Where can I find these glasses?"""
Sorghum crumpled under the wild rain.
"However, after making friends with Wang Qiyao, she became more thoughtful."
"'This Mrs Lian,' said Grannie Liu: 'she can't be more than eighteen or nineteen years old."
"Even the bed had been taken away, leaving only a few workers behind to straighten up the remaining items on set."
"'If there were a way, do you suppose I should have waited till now before trying it out?"
When school finally let out the two rushed out of the gate and hopped onto the trolley car.
She forced herself to say something.
'I wonder if Grannie has eaten yet today?'
"That morning, right at dawn, I went down the mountain to feed the pigs."
People told him that I wasn't a mute.
"From then on Bao-yu treated Aroma with even greater consideration than before, whilst Aroma for her part redoubled the devotion with which she served him."
Then one day she told Wang Qiyao in a confessional tone that her cousin had invited them back to the film studio but she had already declined the offer.
"""It's a sort of science toy we made for the Capital Planetarium."
"Equally ill at ease, Aroma giggled softly."
She came to see the film studio as a gift that she could offer to Wang Qiyao.
"When he was properly dressed, they went to rejoin Grandmother Jia and the rest."
"On the contrary, she even felt a bit bad for Wu Peizhen—because she was so ugly."
"I was scared and stopped, leaning over her body."
"If they were hungry, they snatched two people, keeping one and sending the other into the village to demand flatbreads with eggs and green onions rolled inside."
"If you've got the guts, come again tomorrow!'"
"Trinket fell for it and dodged, and as he did so, the boy's elbow came crashing across into his midriff and winded him completely."
"'Now where we live may be out in the country, but it's still ""in the Emperor's shadow"", as they say."
"It was really a tiring job, and impossible to slack off."
"So saying, she instructed the little maid to slip quietly round to the back of old Lady Jia's quarters and ask if they were serving lunch yet."
"You mustn't let yourself throw up, Fenglian."
"She rose from the seat, stepped grandly onto the pole, and alit in a tuft of cornflowers."
The man shrieked in pain; blood trickled from his nose.
Wang Qiyao never had to worry about Wu Peizhen being jealous of her—and she certainly had no reason to be jealous of Wu Peizhen.
"Sitting in a chair and listening to the sound of the wind, Chen Qingyang would look back at what happened and begin to have doubts about everything."
"What I've seen is enough, and I don't need any more confirmation."
Both of them felt a bit gloomy and Wu Peizhen fell silent.
That means I've become a little Palace Eunuch myself!
"Chen Qingyang said that the military deputy would definitely not go easy on me, perhaps I would be kept-in-mind half to death."
"However, this got me into a lot more trouble."
Someone asked the cousin who his guests were and he told him.
There are several copies of it.
"At the end were two tall radio telescopes with dishes fifty meters in diameter, built in 2006."
Wu Peizhen was a rather careless girl.
"He says I've got to fight with him every day, until I can beat him."
"I said, since you don't even want to look at him, let's just forget the whole thing."
"'Were you just passing by, or have you come specially?'"
'I'm just happy about. . . about remembering it the minute you mentioned it again.'
"""Well, since Professor Ye asked me to help you, let's do the observation."
Sha took out a notebook computer and rushed to turn it on.
"In any case, slapping me was unfair."
"He told them to wait a little while, and then he would take them to watch a special effects shoot that was going on at one of the other sets!"
'I'm just happy about. . . about remembering it the minute you mentioned it again.'
"Jia Rong came hurrying back, wreathed in smiles, and looked at Xi-feng with eyebrows arched inquiringly."
"He slept till evening, when a junior eunuch brought in their supper."
"If he had emerged the victor, it would have been a very different story."
"Maybe my own death, like Yang Dong's."
"Turning her face away, she said, ""What I mean is, you should show the guy some respect."
"'Well then, don't sit around doing nothing."
'We are getting to be quite strangers with everybody.
"FOUR DECADES THE story spans, and it all began the day she went to the film studio."
You'd better bring three taels yourself!'
"It turned out not only did I live, but I wasn't even paralyzed, which was a good thing for me though she wasn't crazy about it."
"The cousin told them all this as he led them off to see the special effects shoot, where they saw smoke, fire, even ghosts."
As she breathed the free air she studied Yu Zhan'ao's broad shoulders and narrow waist.
"Her initial hopes may have been dampened, but the anxiety that came with anticipation had been relieved."
"'If it's the tiniest bit chipped,' said Xi-feng, 'I'll have the hide off you!'"
"Her reason for going rested entirely in making Wang Qiyao happy, so naturally she had hoped it would be a wonderful trip."
That was what happened in the morning.
He eventually succeeded in jumping up and landing a head-butt right in the boy's midriff.
To live in the world of the film studio is to lead a dual life.
During the previous few takes the light had been marked by an unbridled brilliance.
"That was because when I was doing it, she didn't make a sound; she simply put her arms under her head and looked at me in a very thoughtful way."
"I want to see the isotropic fluctuation in the overall cosmic microwave background, between one and five percent,"" he said, quoting from Shen's email."
"Later, when I was in the hospital, nobody came to see me either."
We must leave it to the good Lord to decide whether He'll help us or not.
The lights turned on and off.
"So saying, she instructed the little maid to slip quietly round to the back of old Lady Jia's quarters and ask if they were serving lunch yet."
There is no need to tell me.'
"Whatever brought him to our team, I made up my mind to stay mute."
Just bring them all to me.
It's Master Lian's wife who does all the managing –
"Many who participated in Red Coast are still alive."""
"He lay there, trying to remember Whiskers' fight with the wrestlers in the tavern."
"One glance told them that she was an outsider, but just as she was getting ready to ask directions they would immediately look away."
"I was hospitalized for a whole week, and once I could get around, I went straight back to see her."
"'It's just that. . . what with killing that boy yesterday, I can't seem to think straight, it must have gone clean out of my mind."
At the sight of it Ban-er set up a clamour for some meat and was silenced by Grannie Liu with a resounding slap.
'You're probably the one who's not got the guts!
The two returned to the first set only to discover that everyone had gone.
"The boots reached the door, and came on into the room."
This was one occasion when even Wu Peizhen saw through Wang Qiyao.
'If only I'd taken old Whiskers up on his offer!
"When she said that, the band of flush was fading from her chest."
"Trinket lunged back, but it was a feint: Misty stepped aside, let Trinket surge on, and chopped him on the back with the side of his hand."
Wang ducked back into the car and left the planetarium.
"So saying, she instructed the little maid to slip quietly round to the back of old Lady Jia's quarters and ask if they were serving lunch yet."
Trinket walked a few steps closer.
"Ever a crafty fighter, Trinket now let go of the boy's legs, got behind him, and landed him a good kick on the backside."
"Since it was drizzling, she had put on a pair of embroidered slippers soaked a dozen times in tong oil, which made a squishing sound when she walked."
Trinket had never even heard of the Antelope.
"Sha stared at the waveform, terrified."
"The bearers streaked down the road, yet the sedan chair was as steady as a skiff skimming across whitecaps."
"'Go and have a look, then."
"By drinking to allay his anxiety, Gou-er merely put himself more out of temper."
"My mother also had bound feet, and just seeing them saddened me so much that I felt compelled to shout: 'Down with feudalism!"
"The sedan chair was like a dinghy tossed about by the waves, and Grandma held on to the wooden seat for dear life."
I kept silent as I heard the words.
"'Clever Old Turtle-head!' thought Trinket, silently cursing to himself."
She grabbed a small urchin from their midst and drew him towards her.
The planetarium staffer finally emerged and asked him whether he was done.
You won't be so pleased when I've made a big rip in that smart gown of yours!'
She noticed the glow emitting from the electric lamp and the rippling shadows of the lotus-shaped lampshade projecting onto the three walls of the set.
"It was real, not dramatic—the kind of beauty that people noticed on the street and photo studios displayed in their front windows."
But they did not see a soul who even faintly resembled a movie star.
"Grandma could hear the shh-shh of rustling sorghum, one wave close upon another, carrying the sound off into the distance."
You'll have to go from here round to the back gate in the other street and ask for her there.'
"It was the remnants of the big bang, the still-warm embers of Creation."
"Wang thought that if the architect had intended to express a feeling about the universe, the design was a success:"
What's the sense in rampaging around here at home when you could go out and help yourself?'
I also told him that I would get some people together for a gang fight.
I have been destroyed by a miserly father and a heartless mother!
"'That's all very well, Mother,' put in Gou-er's wife, 'but just take a look at us!"
There is no need to tell me.'
"However, since none of them was sure about whether or not my back was broken, they were all afraid to move me."
Their name was Wang and they were natives of these parts.
Her brother has been promoted; but I shouldn't be surprised if she at least didn't still remember us.
Only because Wu Peizhen stepped out of her own shoes and empathized completely with her friend was she able to understand the grief Wang Qiyao was going through.
Time spent in a film studio is never humdrum; the experience always hints at life's greater meaning.
"The uninfected patients all fled to their homes to recuperate, and the doctors went down to the production team to provide medical care."
"He was so near she could have touched the pale, taut skin of his shaved head with her toe."
"Shortly after leaving the village, the lazy musicians stopped playing, while the bearers quickened their pace."
He let out a great war cry and threw himself straight into the attack.
Now my job is to attend to their ladyships and the young mistresses when they go out.
I kicked him into a manure pit right in front of the cattle pen for a shit bath.
Wu came to fetch him again the following morning.
But I hope that you will explain the truth to me when you feel the time is right.
Chen Qingyang then told him that she knew nothing about me.
I don't know what sort of relations we are and what I should call her.'
'Cripes!' he cried silently to himself.
"'If you won't lend it, my father will say that I didn't ask properly and I shall get a beating."
"When people said she was damaged goods and I was her lover, she came to see me every day."
I doubt the people at the door would bother to tell them we were there.
"Turning her face away, she said, ""What I mean is, you should show the guy some respect."
"When they were indoors, Zhou Rui's wife ordered her little hired help to pour out some tea."
"'I can see you've never done any wrestling,' laughed Misty."
"The city looked the same as before, only dimmer."
"If there had been no Wang Er to tell her the route, she wouldn't have been able to find such a tiny hut in the vast, wild mountains."
"I just get him in a good shoulder grip, then—'"
"Even if I did have rich friends or relations, I'm not so sure they would want to be bothered with the likes of us.'"
"He handed him a small suitcase and said, ""There are five pairs of 3K glasses in here, all fully charged."
She had yet to figure that out.
"If I didn't confess, he would mobilize the masses to deal with me."
'Don't mind him; just stay where you are!
He let out a great war cry and threw himself straight into the attack.
"'Excellent kungfu!' cried his opponent, grappling him with both arms, and delivering a swinging kick with his left foot."
So I didn't really care whether I existed or not.
"It was time to rest, so the bearers lowered the sedan chair to the ground."
"The bearers streaked down the road, yet the sedan chair was as steady as a skiff skimming across whitecaps."
Which of the Goong-goongs do you work for?'
"'At one time Her Ladyship used to see quite a lot of her, which is why I thought it would be in order for me to bring her in."
"'I can see you've never done any wrestling,' laughed Misty."
"Wang thought that if the architect had intended to express a feeling about the universe, the design was a success:"
"Trinket reached out frantically as he fell, clutching at the boy's legs, and the two of them went down together."
"Sha paced back and forth anxiously, pausing from time to time to look at the sequence of numbers Wang was writing down."
It was then that she began to calm down and her tensions eased.
Don't put yours to a lot of trouble!' and he hurried out.
I was a little offended by what she said and she realized that too.
Trinket didn't follow this at all.
"There, at each side of the stone lions which flanked the gates of the Rong Mansion, she saw a cluster of horses and palanquins."
"Whenever Wu Peizhen invited her out after school, Wang Qiyao would almost always find some excuse not to go."
"How many times Trinket had sat listening to the storytellers' tales, and how many times he'd dreamed of one day being a hero himself—Trinket the Brave Man and True!"
A number of important-looking gentlemen sat in the gateway sunning their bellies and discoursing with animated gestures on a wide variety of topics.
"A couple of days later, Luo Xiaosi brought several people to the hospital to see me."
"The more transparent something was, the more mysterious it seemed."
"Sorghum plants lining the road shone like ebony, dense and impenetrable; weeds and wildflowers grew in such profusion they seemed to block the road."
The three satellites and the ground-based observatory confirmed one fact: The universe was flickering.
My words still echoed in her ears.
"A heavy bracelet of twisted silver slid down to her wrist, and as she looked at the coiled-snake design her thoughts grew chaotic and disoriented."
"The panting bearers were drenched with sweat as they entered Toad Hollow, over which the air hung heavily."
"Xi-feng suddenly seemed to remember something, and called to him through the window, 'Rong, come back!'"
"This was the grin he reserved for tourists, as he had grown used to their astounding scientific illiteracy."
"Equipment for receiving satellite data was squeezed into the main computer room, and three terminals displayed the information sent by the three satellites."
"In case nothing came of the screen test, it would be her own little secret and she could pretend that nothing had ever happened."
"Bao-yu had long been attracted by Aroma's somewhat coquettish charms and tugged at her purposefully, anxious to share with her the lesson he had learned from Disenchantment."
"When they were indoors, Zhou Rui's wife ordered her little hired help to pour out some tea."
Trinket engaged in a quick moment's reflection: 'Misty has obviously had lessons—that's why he keeps getting the better of me.
"But if you have got anything to say, you really ought to tell the mistress."
"At the end were two tall radio telescopes with dishes fifty meters in diameter, built in 2006."
"The screen test became a source of sorrow for both of them, leaving them with a deep sense of defeat."
"Believe me, you won't get anywhere."""
All the mystery and grandeur of the film studio hung suspended in the light shimmering outside her veil.
"She's grown up to be a real beauty too, has Mrs Lian."
"He had another coughing fit, and went on: 'You've done quite well today."
"Since I couldn't imagine these things, they must be evidence of my existence."
And with that he left the room.
"I said if she thought I was a faker, why did she believe me?"
By then I began to realize that it was really unnecessary for me to prove my existence to others.
"At least my project only depends on satellite data and has nothing to do with these 'tourist attractions.'"""
"Trinket took advantage of the fact that Misty was busy speaking and momentarily off his guard, to launch a counter-attack."
These people are all eunuchs working for the Emperor. . .'
"She said she would come back to visit me in a couple of days, but she never did."
"First, when you met her, you couldn't get a word out; then, when you did start talking, it was all ""your nephew"" this and ""your nephew"" that!"
She ripped the tart-smelling veil away from her face and laid it on her knees.
"She said that it was a serious film, unlike this one, which was pure buffoonery, no better than a circus sideshow."
"Many local families had dreamed of marrying into the Shan family, despite rumours that Shan Bianlang had leprosy."
"Finally, the team leader came over and said, Go phone Chen Qingyang."
"He seemed to have turned into nothing but a simple timer, a bell that tolled for he knew not whom."
Perhaps she was also suffering from insomnia.
The two of them had a good laugh.
Wu Peizhen was a rather careless girl.
'You obviously don't know the first thing about wrestling!'
"And the stage eunuchs always held those long horsehair fly-whisks, and kept waving them around in the air."
"Now Master Rong, he is her real nephew."
"Suddenly she woke from her trance, her face blushing with embarrassment."
"In actual fact, when Old Hai had spoken of stealing a book, Trinket's heart had sunk."
Trinket walked a few steps closer.
There was a strange frisson attached to that scene; it was the most dramatic moment in Wang Qiyao's quiet life.
A place like that would help cultivate morality and nourish the inner nature.
"This was partly because she had plenty of psychic capital to draw on, but also because she simply did not mind."
"Then one day when I'm back at home, ha ha!"
One of the lights was about to burn out and flickered irregularly.
"On the ride home, neither was in the mood to talk and they sat silently, listening to the ringing bells of the trolley."
Jia Rong saluted his aunt Manchu fashion.
"He was tired, so he sat down on a bench."
"After all, she thought, her own parents wouldn't lie to her."
"I was hospitalized for a whole week, and once I could get around, I went straight back to see her."
Or maybe it will be a disaster like the great tsunami that swept through the Indian Ocean more than a decade ago.
By then I began to realize that it was really unnecessary for me to prove my existence to others.
I was a little offended by what she said and she realized that too.
The team leader didn't tell me because he thought I knew already.
His thoughts ran on: 'What a fool I was just now!
"Trinket walked across to the dining-table, where bowls and chopsticks had been laid, four dishes and a soup, all untouched."
"She's grown up to be a real beauty too, has Mrs Lian."
"Trinket recalled Whiskers' fight with the seven wrestlers at the inn, and shot out a quick left that caught the boy hard, fair and square, on the lower cheek."
Trinket hopped out of bed and was at Old Hai's bedside in a trice.
